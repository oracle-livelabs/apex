Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this LiveLab will guide you step by step in crafting a dynamic and intelligent online bookstore. 

Estimated Time: 3 hours 52 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

- Develop an APEX Application
- Integrate REST Data Sources
- Customize Themes and UI
- Implement E-commerce Features (Cart, Wishlist, Orders, Profile, etc)
- Configure Authentication & Security
- Integrate Payment Processing with Razorpay
- Leverage AI Capabilities (RAG, AI Vision, AI Assistant)
- Set Up Push Notifications
- Design and Manage Email Templates

### Prerequisites for Building this App:

- A paid Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account or a FREE Oracle Cloud account with $300 credits for 30 days to use on other services. Read more about it at: [oracle.com/cloud/free/](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/).

- An OCI compartment. An Oracle Cloud account comes with two pre-configured compartments - The tenancy (root compartment) and ManagedCompartmentForPaaS (created by Oracle for Oracle Platform services).

- The logged-in user should have the necessary privileges to create and manage Autonomous Database instances in this compartment. You can configure these privileges via an OCI IAM Policy. If you are using a Free Tier account, it is likely that you already have all the necessary privileges.

*Note: This workshop assumes you are using Oracle APEX 24.2. Some of the features might not be available in prior releases and the instructions, flow, and screenshots might differ if you use an older version of Oracle APEX.*
