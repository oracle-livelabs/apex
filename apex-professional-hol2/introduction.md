# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**

Oracle APEX is a low-code application platform for Oracle Database. APEX Application Development, Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), and Autonomous JSON Database are fully managed services, pre-integrated and pre-configured with APEX, for rapidly building and deploying modern data-driven applications in Oracle Cloud. Business users, citizens, and application developers can create enterprise apps 20X faster with 100X less code without learning complex web technologies with just a browser.

In this workshop, you create the database objects required to build the **Online Shopping Application**. You leverage the Sample Dataset called Customer Orders to build the Online Shopping Application. Later, you also learn to use Quick SQL by creating sample tables.

### Recap

In the previous hands-on lab, you learned how to create an APEX Workspace, navigate the major components of Oracle APEX, and install and run a packaged application.

Estimated Time: 40 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Install a sample dataset into your Oracle APEX Workspace.

- Add new columns to the existing Products table, populate the new columns and create lookup tables.

- Create a package to manage the Shopping Cart.

- Create database objects using Quick SQL.

- Load data using the Data generator and Data Workshop page.
