# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**
racle APEX is a low-code application platform for Oracle Database. APEX Application Development, Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), and Autonomous JSON Database are fully managed services, pre-integrated and pre-configured with APEX, for rapidly building and deploying modern data-driven applications in Oracle Cloud. Business users, citizen, and application developers can create enterprise apps 20X faster with 100X less code â€” without having to learn complex web technologies with just a browser.

In this workshop, you implement features to update the badge and icon shown in the navigation bar after the customer has added/edited/removed a product from the shopping cart, refresh the shopping cart region, review the product details, and the items added to the Shopping Cart. You also implement the feature to add, edit, or remove the product from the shopping cart.


### Recap

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives
* Create Dynamic actions for the Shopping Carts Page.
