# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**
Oracle APEX is a feature of Oracle Database, including the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), Autonomous JSON Database (JSON) and APEX Application Development (APEX) services. Oracle APEX is a low-code development environment with various features and tools where you can create an application fast. In the future, rather than emailing spreadsheets to gather information, you will know how to easily create an app in minutes using APEX and email the URL instead. The result will be a secure, scalable, multi-user app that provides a single source-of-truth for your data!

### Recap
In the last hands-on lab, you practised creating validations on the Page Items and adding Page processes with types like Invoke API, Clear and a branch to a page.

In this workshop, you implement features to update the badge and icon shown in the navigation bar after the customer has added/edited/removed a product from the shopping cart, refresh the shopping cart region, review the product details, and the items added to the Shopping Cart. You also implement the feature to add, edit, or remove the product from the shopping cart.
