# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**
Oracle APEX is a low-code application platform for Oracle Database. APEX Application Development, Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), and Autonomous JSON Database are fully managed services, pre-integrated and pre-configured with APEX, for rapidly building and deploying modern data-driven applications in Oracle Cloud. Business users, citizen, and application developers can create enterprise apps 20X faster with 100X less code â€” without having to learn complex web technologies with just a browser.

In this workshop, you navigate to **Demo Projects Application** and create an **Interactive Grid** and **Smart Filters** Pages.

Later, in the **Online Shopping Cart Application**, you will create:
  - **Application Items** and **Application Process**
  - **Cards** pages to view Product Details and Customer Reviews in the Online Shopping Application.
  - **Faceted Search Page** to view the Products.

### Recap
In the previous workshop, you learned to navigate and review the Page Designer panes. You acquired the skills to construct a normal page, incorporate regions, sub-regions, and page items, and manage the locking and unlocking of pages.



Estimated Time: 40 minutes

* Create Pages to Search and Edit the Projects and Tasks in the **Demo Projects** Application.
