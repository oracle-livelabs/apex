# Add Cards and Faceted search page to the Shopping Cart Application

In this lab, you'll extend the functionality of the Online Shopping Application by adding features to the shopping cart, product pages, and a faceted search page. Customers can review items in the cart, edit quantities, remove products, and proceed to checkout. You'll also create pages allowing users to view product details and customer reviews, enhancing the application's user experience.

The tasks will guide you through the process of adding dynamic functionality to your application using Oracle APEX components such as Cards and Application Processes.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

## Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will:

- Create application items and processes for managing the shopping cart.

- Design Card regions to display product details and customer reviews.

- Implement a faceted search page to list and filter products.

- Set up actions to edit cart items and handle checkout processes.
