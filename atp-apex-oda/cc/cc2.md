# Implement Custom Component

## Introduction

**Oracle Digital Assistant** allows you to build integrations with backend services by creating **Custom Components**.

Custom Components are a bridge between **Skills** on Oracle Digital Assistant and the **Services** where information can be fetched.

Custom components allow you as well to plug-in custom code logic into a bot conversation.

That is exactly what we are going to build.

**Custom Components** are developed using **Node.js**. They are just a REST **API** that offer an endpoint to **Skills** bots to `GET` and `POST` actions.

You can package related **Custom Components** together.

Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes

Watch the video below for an overview of the Implement Custom Component lab

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Verify if Node.js is installed on cloud shell
- Create a custom component to integrate with backend services
- Deploy the custom component

### Prerequisites

- This lab assumes you have created the application and enabled the REST API

## Task 1: Verify if Node.js installed

In order to walk through this lab you need to develop the integration with **REST API**. You need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) for that.

Node.js is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime. **Node.js** is designed to build scalable network applications.

1. On the Oracle Cloud console, click on the cloud shell icon to open the Oracle cloud shell.

    ![Open Oracle shell](./images/cloud-shell-icon.png " ")

2. Run the following commands to verify if Node.js is installed on the Oracle cloud shell virtual machine.

    ```
    <copy>node -v</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>npm -v</copy>
    ```

    ```
    <copy>npx @oracle/bots-node-sdk -v</copy>
    ```

## Task 2: Create a Custom Component to integrate with backend services

Oracle provides **Oracle Bots Node.js SDK**, a free utility that makes custom components development very easy.

Ready to create your **Custom Component** scaffolding.

1. Open a **terminal** and type:

    ```
    <copy>npx @oracle/bots-node-sdk init tasks-cc --component-name tasks</copy>
    ```

    Where `tasks-cc` is the name of the custom component module. And `tasks` is the name of our first custom component implementation.

2. The **result** should look like this:

    ```bash
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    Custom Component package 'tasks-cc' created successfully!
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------

    Usage:

      cd tasks-cc
      npm start    Start a dev server with the component package
    ```

    Executing that command created a new folder `tasks-cc` with a hierarchy that has a `package.json` file and a `components` folder with a file `tasks.js` inside.

3. **Change directory** to `tasks-cc` on the Command Prompt or Terminal:

    ```
    <copy>cd tasks-cc</copy>
    ```

    This custom component is going to make REST API calls to fetch information from APEX. To do so, we need to install an extra library called [node-fetch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-fetch).

4. Install the library with the following command:

    ```
    <copy>npm install node-fetch</copy>
    ```

5. Edit the file `package.json` in `tasks-cc` folder. You can use your favorite text editor.

    ```
    <copy>vi package.json</copy>
    ```

6. We have to **change the name** of the package from the generic `my-custom-component` to something more personalized like `tasks-cc`. Check line number 2:

    ![Package name change](./images/package_name_change.png)

7. **Save** the file with the changes.

    Great, we are now ready to **change the code** of our **custom component implementation**.

8. **Open** the file `tasks.js` with your favorite text editor. You can find this file in the **components folder**.

    ```
    <copy>vi components/tasks.js</copy>
    ```

9. **Edit** the file `tasks.js` and **replace** the whole content with the following code or download it from <a href="./files/tasks.js" target="\_blank">here</a> to download the customer component source code.

    **IMPORTANT**: **Remember** to change the `URL_COPIED_FROM_APEX` in line 5 with the **URL** copied on **APEX** in **Lab 2**.

    ```
    <copy>"use strict";

    const fetch = require("node-fetch");

    const ordsURL = "URL_COPIED_FROM_APEX";

    function getTasks(urlRequest, logger, callback) {
    logger.info(urlRequest);
    fetch(urlRequest)
        .then((res) => {
        if (!res.ok) {
            const errorMessage = `Invalid status ${res.status}`;
            logger.error(errorMessage);
            callback(errorMessage);
            throw new Error(errorMessage);
        }
        return res.json();
        })
        .then((body) => {
        callback(null, body.items);
        })
        .catch((err) => {
        logger.error(err.message);
        callback(err.message);
        });
    }

    module.exports = {
        metadata: () => ({
            name: "com.example.tasks",
            supportedActions: ["success", "failure"],
        }),
        invoke: (conversation, done) => {
            getTasks(ordsURL, conversation.logger(), (err, data) => {
            if (err) {
                conversation.transition("failure");
                done();
                return;
            }
            const tasks = data.map((task) => task.text);
            conversation.reply(tasks.join("\n")).transition("success");
            done();
            });
        },
    };</copy>
    ```

    ![Copy URL from APEX](./images/apex_copy_url.png)

    It should look like this:

    ```javascript
    const ordsURL =
        "https://xxx-yyy.adb.region.oraclecloudapps.com/ords/tasks/oda/tasks/";
    ```

10. Don't forget the **save** tasks.js file.

## Task 3: Deploy the custom component

**Custom Components** can be deployed in different ways:

- **Local Component Container**: single instance deployment as custom component resides in skill bot
- **Mobile Hub**: multi-channel environment with mobile extras and shared instance deployment
- **Node Container**: shared instance but no need for mobile extras

1. We are going to **install** our custom component **locally** as a **component container**. Very simple, we need to pack our code in a single file that contains everything:

    Package your **Custom Component** by running on your Command Prompt or Terminal:

    ```
    <copy>npm pack</copy>
    ```

2. The **output** looks like this:

    ![Pack result](./images/cloud-shell-node_result.png)

    There will be a new file in your `tasks-cc` folder called `tasks-cc-1.0.0.tgz`.

## Task 4: Upload the file to Object Storage

1. Click the **Navigation Menu** in the upper left, navigate to **Storage**, and select **Buckets**.

	![](https://oracle-livelabs.github.io/common/images/console/storage-buckets.png " ")

2. Choose right **Compartment** from the compartment drop-down and click on **Create Bucket**.

    ![Click create bucket](./images/create-bucket-1.png)

3. Name your bucket - **oda** and click **Create**

    ![Name the bucket](./images/oda-bucket.png)

4. Once the bucket is created, click on the **oda** bucket.

    ![Click bucket](./images/click-bucket.png)

5. Make note of your bucket name and namespace.

    ![Copy details](./images/copy-details.png)

6. In the below command, replace the `namespace` and `bucket-name` with the namespace and the bucket name details copied earlier.

    Run the command in `tasks-cc` folder in Oracle cloud shell to upload the `tasks-cc-1.0.0.tgz` file to your bucket in object storage.

    ```
    <copy>oci os object put -ns namespace -bn bucket-name --file tasks-cc-1.0.0.tgz</copy>
    ```

    ![Upload object](./images/upload-object.png)

7. Navigate back to your bucket to view the uploaded object - `tasks-cc-1.0.0.tgz`.

    Click on ellipse on the right corner of the object and click **Download** to download the object on to your machine.

    ![Click ellipse](./images/click-ellipse.png)

You may now [proceed to the next lab](#next).
