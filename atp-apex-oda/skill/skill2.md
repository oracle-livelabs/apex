# Create Digital Assistant Skill

## Introduction

**Digital assistants** consist of one or more **skills**, which are individual **chat bots** that are focused on specific types of tasks.

You will create a **skill** that can be used for interactions with a backend service, using the **Custom Component** you built on previous workshop.

As part of this process, you will:

- **Create** a new skill
- **Import** your Custom Component (the `tgz` file you generated with `npm pack`)
- **Create** two intents: `Greeting` and `ListTasks`

Watch the video below for an overview of the Create Digital Assistant Skill lab

We have to access to **Digital Assistant** section in the **Oracle Cloud Dashboard**.

![ODA Menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/common/images/console/analytics-assist.png " ")

Go to **Digital Assistant Dashboard** as we did on **Lab 3**. As a reminder check the following screenshot:

Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Build your first skill
- Import the custom component
- Create intents
- Integrate your custom component with the intents

### Prerequisites

- This lab assumes you have successfully completed all the previous labs

## Task 1: Build your first Skill

In this workshop, we're starting from scratch. So the first thing you'll do is **create** a new skill.

1. Click on hamburger menu on the top right corner and click on **Development** drop-down menu and choose **Skills**.

    ![Create Skill](./images/skills_1_new.png)

2. **Click** on `+ New Skill` button to start:

    ![Create Skill](./images/oda_lab5_3.png)

3. **Fill** the information like in the image and click **Create** button:

    ![Create Skill](./images/cc_import_1_new.png)

## Task 2: Import the Custom Component

Import Custom Component is very simple.

1. **Go** to the **Components** view ![Components](./images/components-icon.png) on the left menu. Select `+ Service`.

    ![Components View](./images/components-view.png)

    The web form to **upload** the file will **show up**.
    We will fill out all the information of this web form.

2. Select **Upload a component package file (a .tgz file created by running bots-node-sdk pack or npm pack) or drag it here**.

    ![Create Skill](./images/cc_import_2.png)

3. **Upload** `tasks-cc-1.0.0.tgz` file that we downloaded earlier in lab 4.

    ![Create Skill](./images/cc_import_3_new.png)

4. **Fill** the rest of the information and remember to `Enable Component Logging` with the toggle button

    - **Name**: tasks
    - **Description**: Tasks Custom Component
    - **Embedded Container**: is selected by default. Leave it like that

5. Finally **Create** the Service.

    ![Create Skill](./images/cc_import_4.png)

6. **Wait** for the deployment to be ready.

    ![Create Skill](./images/cc_import_5.png)

7. **Make sure** the `Status` is `Ready`. You see all the **information** on this page like in this screenshot.

    ![Create Skill](./images/cc_import_6.png)

## Task 3: Create intents

Oracle Digital Assistant's underlying **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** engine doesn't inherently know about the business or task that a skill is supposed to assist with. For the skill to understand what it should react to, you need to define intents and examples (utterances) for how a user would request a specific intent.

Let's create a **Greeting Intent**.

1. **Go** to the **Intent** view ![Intents](./images/intents-icon.png) on the left menu. Select `+ Intent`.

    ![Intent Create](./images/intents_1.png)

1. We will start working on the **Intent** page. The page by default looks like this screenshot:

    ![Intent Default values](./images/intents_2.png)

3. **Modify** default values for:

    - **Conversation Name**: Greeting
    - **Name**: Greeting
    - **Utterances to Add**: In this field is where you have to type the different Greetings that you want to include as part of the Intent. Type on this field `hi` and click enter. Wait to be added as part of the intents. Type on the same field `hello` and wait to be added as before

    The two **Intents** that you added a few seconds ago will be visible in the page. Check the following screenshot to confirm.

    ![Intent Greeting](./images/intents_3.png)

4. **Click** on `+ Intent` on the same screen to add more Intents to the conversation.

  ![Intent Create](./images/intents_4.png)

5. **Modify** default values for:

    - **Conversation Name**: ListTasks
    - **Name**: ListTasks
    - **Utterances to Add**: In this field is where you have to type the different list of tasks that you want to include as part of the Intent. Type on this field `list my tasks` and click enter. Wait to be added as part of the intents. Type on the same field `show me my tasks` and wait to be added as before. And finally type on the same field `tasks` and wait to be added as before.

    The three **Intents** that you added a few seconds ago will be visible in the page. Check the following screenshot to confirm.

    ![Intent default](./images/intents_5.png)

## Task 4: Put everything together

Time to **integrate** your **Custom Component with the Intent** `ListTasks` created before.

1. **Go** to the **Flows** view ![Flows](./images/flows-menu-item.png) on the left menu.

    You will **see** the `YAML` file that define the behavior of your **Skill**.

    ![Flows 1](./images/flows_1.png)

1. **Delete** the full content of the **Flows** section and leave the canvas **empty**.

    ![Flows 2](./images/flows_2.png)

2. **Copy** the `YAML` content from <a href="./files/flow.yml" target="\_blank">here</a> and paste it into the canvas.

     The **Flows** section should look like this one:

    ![Flows 3](./images/flows_3_3.png)

3. **Make sure** the syntax is correct. **Click** on the `Validate` button. You will get a warning message **We have identified some issues that might cause problems with the my tasks skill. Open the logger window to see more details.** on the top of the page as you can see on the image below. You can explore the warning on **View validation results** section to learn. We can proceed with next steps.

    ![Flows 4](./images/flows_4_3.png)

4. Click **Train** button to run the **Machine Learning Algorithm**.

    ![Flows 5](./images/flows_5_2.png)

5. **Be sure** that you get the **correct train message** confirmation on the top of the page as you can see on the image below:

    ![Flows 6](./images/flows_6_2.png)

6. **Run** the test of the skill clicking the `Play` button next to `Validate`.

    ![Run Flows](./images/flows_7_2.png)

    The way to test the conversation is typing any of the **Intents** that we have created on this Lab5.

    For example: say `hi` and wait for the bot answer. In this case the answer is `Greetings, hooman!`. Type the next Intent `show me my tasks` and wait for the bot answer. Now the answer is `Get concert tickets` and `Buy bread`.

    ![Test](./images/oda_test_1.gif)

    > NOTE:
    >
    > If you see an **error message** at this point, it means there is a **problem** with the **Custom Component Code**.
    >
    > To get more information about the issue, check the logs.
    >
    > Go to **Components** view ![Components Icon](./images/components-icon.png) on the left menu and **click** on **Diagnostics** for your **Custom Component**, then on **View Logs**.
    >
    > ![View Logs](./images/cc_view_logs.png)
    >
    > The **result** should be something like this:
    > ![View Logs](./images/service_log.png)

## Task 5: Add a new item and test

To see how we **request** against the **database**, we can **add** a new item.

1. **Insert** your third element in the collection of data by going to **APEX** and on the Top Menu on **SQL Workshop**, click **Object Browser** as we did on **Lab 2**:

    ![](./images/apex_object_browser_menu_clean.png)

2. Select **TASKS** table on the left of the APEX page and **click** the tab **Data**, then click **Insert Row**:

    ![Object Browser Data](./images/object_data_inser_new.png)

3. **Add** a new **Text** like `New item!` and **click** **Create**:

    ![Object Browser Data](./images/apex_object_data_insert_item.png)

4. **Confirm** the row has been created:

    ![Object Browser Data](./images/object_data_insert_row_created.png)

5. **Run** the chat again but before **reset** the previous **conversation**.

    For example: reset the conversation by clicking on **Reset** then say `hi` and wait for the bot answer. Type the next Intent `show me my tasks` and wait for the bot answer. Now the answer is `Get concert tickets`, `Buy bread`, and `New Item!`.

Congratulations! Well done!
