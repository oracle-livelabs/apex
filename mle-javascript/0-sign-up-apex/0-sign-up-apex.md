# Sign up for an APEX Workspace

## Introduction

Oracle Application Express (APEX) is a low-code application platform for Oracle Database. APEX Application Development, Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) are fully managed services, pre-integrated and pre-configured with APEX, for rapidly building and deploying modern data-driven applications in Oracle Cloud. Business users, citizen and application developers can create enterprise apps 20X faster with 100X less codeâ€”without having to learn complex web technologies with just a browser. To start, you will need to decide on the service you are going to use for this workshop, and then create an APEX workspace accordingly.

If you already have an APEX 20.2 Workspace provisioned, you can skip this lab.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### What is an APEX Workspace?
An APEX Workspace is a logical domain where you define APEX applications. Each workspace is associated with one or more database schemas (database users) which are used to store the database objects, such as tables, views, packages, and more. APEX applications are built on top of these database objects.

### How Do I Find My APEX Release Version?
To determine which release of Oracle Application Express you are currently running, do one of the following:
* View the release number on the Workspace home page:
    - Sign in to Oracle Application Express. The Workspace home page appears. The current release version displays in bottom right corner.

### Where to Run the Lab
You can run this lab in Oracle Database 21c with APEX 20.2 installed. This includes the new APEX Application Development Service and the "Always Free" Oracle Autonomous Database.

Below are steps on how to sign up for either an *APEX Application Development* Service, an *Oracle Autonomous Database* cloud service or *apex.oracle.com* service.
- The Always Free APEX Application Development Service is ideal for Oracle APEX Development. You can upgrade it with a flexible paid option that allows to concentrate your efforts on APEX development without worrying about the database management. It provides 1 OCPU and 20 GB and can be extended as needed once upgraded to a paid service.
- The Always Free Oracle Autonomous Database option is ideal for learning about the Oracle Database and APEX, and provides 1 OCPU and 20 GB of compressed storage. This service can also be utilized for production applications, and can readily be upgraded to a paid service as necessary.

***Note that this lab depends on In-Database JavaScript feature of the Oracle Database 21c which is currently available in four regions only. Please make sure to create a cloud account having one of the followings as the home region:***

- *Germany Central (Frankfurt)*
- *US East (Ashburn)*
- *US West (Phoenix)*
- *UK South (London)*

Click one of the options below to proceed.

## **Option 1**: Oracle APEX Application Development Service

In this part, you will create an Oracle APEX Application Development Service trial account. Once you have signed up for the service, you will create an *APEX Service*. The final step in the process is to provision Oracle APEX.

1.  Please [click this link to create your free account](https://signup.cloud.oracle.com). When you complete the registration process, you'll receive an account with a $300 credit that you can utilize to create an APEX Service. You can then use any remaining credit to continue to explore the Oracle Cloud.

2.  Once the Signup process is complete, you will be logged in automatically to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Console.
    -  In case you have closed the browser, you can always refer to the **Get Started Now with Oracle Cloud** email that you should have received to login to OCI Console.   
    Make a note of your **Username**, **Password**, and **Cloud Account Name**.

        ![](images/get-started-email.png " ")

    - Alternatively, you can login to your Oracle Cloud account by accessing the following URL from your browser:       
    [https://cloud.oracle.com](https://cloud.oracle.com)

        Enter your **Cloud Account Name** in the input field and click the **Next** button.
