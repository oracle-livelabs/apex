# Create the Application

## Introduction

You will get started by creating a skeleton application and you will add to it in each lab until you have built a full application that allows you to create and manage a personal list of books you have read or want to read.

You will also need to sign up for an account on Google Books and obtain an API Key. A Google Books API Key is required for this tutorial, as authentication is needed to get data from the Google Books API.

Estimated Lab Time: 5 minutes


### Objectives
In this lab, you will:  
- Create a new application.  
- Edit the appearance and theme of your application.
- Run your application.  

### Prerequisites

## Task 3: Update the Theme of the App

1. In the tab that your app is running in, there will be a grey toolbar at the bottom of the page. This is your development toolbar that allows you to edit regions in your application user interface (UI) directly in the tab it's running in.  
*Note: If you do not see the grey developer toolbar, mouse over the bottom of your browser window to make it display. End users who log directly into the app will not see this toolbar.*

2. In the dev toolbar, click on **Customize** and then click **Theme Roller**.

    ![Close-up of developer toolbar in runtime application with the Customize menu open](images/dev-toolbar.png " ")

3. Within the Theme Roller, you can modify many different aspects of the application UI. 

2. In the Theme Roller dialog, enter/select the following: 
    - Select Theme: **Redwood Light**
    - Under Redwood Options:
        - Pillar: **Lilac**
    - Under Appearance:
        - Header: **Pillar**
        - Navigation: **Pillar**
        - Body Header: **Dark**

    ![Application page in runtime with Theme roller dialog open](images/theme-roller.png =50%x*)

3. Click **Save As**. In the dialog, for Style Name, enter **Redwood Light Custom**. Finally, click **Save**.
    ![Theme Roller Save as](images/theme-save.png =50%x*)

    You have successfully customized the application theme.

You now know how to create, run, and update the theme of an application. You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
