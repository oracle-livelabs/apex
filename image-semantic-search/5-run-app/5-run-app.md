    The image has been posted on your timeline. Similarly, add as many posts as you would like.

    *Note: Image Format Support: We recommend using JPG images only to ensure compatibility and avoid errors during embedding generation.*

4. Now, click on the **Text to Image** tab and enter your Search Term in the Search Bar and then press **Enter**. The app searches for and displays all the images that contain the corresponding search term.

    In the following example, for text to image search, when you enter "Yellow wheel" in the Search bar, the app displays all the images that contain or relate to a yellow wheel.

    ![Text to Image Search](images/img-class.png " ")

5. To perform an Image to Image search, navigate to the  **Image to Image** tab, upload the image you want to find similar matches for. The app will then search and display all posted images that closely resemble the uploaded image.

    In the following example, for image based search, when you upload an image of a 'yellow wheel', the app displays all posted images that are visually similar or related to the uploaded image.
