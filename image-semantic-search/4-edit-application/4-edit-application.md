# Implement Image and Text Search

## Introduction

In this lab, you will integrate semantic search capabilities directly into the user interface of your APEX Social Media app. Instead of relying on basic keyword filtering, users will be able to search for posts using text or images based on meaning and similarity. Whether itâ€™s finding visually similar images or posts related to a phrase, your app will deliver intelligent, context-aware results.

By the end of this lab, your APEX application will be ready to handle real-time image-based queries with ease.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you:

- Add an Image Upload item to the APEX app for users to perform image-based search.

- Create an Upload button to trigger the search functionality using the uploaded image.

- Add a Reset button to clear the uploaded image and search results, allowing users to start a new search.

- Edit the Timeline region to dynamically reflect results matching the uploaded image or query, ensuring users see only contextually similar posts.

## Task 1: Add Image Upload item for image search

In this task, you will create a new region Page item to upload image for search.

1. Navigate to the Application and click on the **Timeline** page.

            ```

        - Items to Submit: **P1\_ACTION\_ID**

    ![Property Editor](images/true-action-share.png " ")

8. **Save and Run** the page. You can see a Share button for each post. Click on **Share** to open a context menu and choose the app you want to share with. In this example, choose **Mail** and the post is attached as an image in an email draft with an associated text.

    ![App output](images/run-app-share.png " ")

    ![Image share via email](images/image-share-mail.png =60%x*)

## Summary

You have successfully enhanced the Social Media app by integrating semantic image search features. You added an image upload interface, created buttons to trigger and reset searches, and updated the timeline region to display results that closely match the uploaded image or query. Your APEX app can now deliver intelligent, visually driven search experiences powered by AI.
