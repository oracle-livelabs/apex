# Introduction

## Workshop Overview

Welcome to the Low Code Development with Oracle Autonomous Database workshop.

Estimated Time: 80 minutes

### About Oracle APEX

Oracle Application Express (APEX) is a low-code development platform that enables you to build scalable, secure enterprise apps, with world-class features, that can be deployed anywhere.

Using APEX, developers can quickly develop and deploy compelling apps that solve real problems and provide immediate value. You won't need to be an expert in a vast array of technologies to deliver sophisticated solutions. Focus on solving the problem and let APEX take care of the rest.

If you have Oracle Database, you already have Oracle APEX. APEX is a fully supported no-cost feature of Oracle Database – the most complete, integrated, and secure data platform for any scale deployment. This solid foundation enables apps built using APEX to natively access and interact with all of the capabilities of Oracle Database.

### Objectives
-  Create an Autonomous Transaction Processing instance
-  Access APEX in the Oracle Cloud
-  Create an APEX Workspace
-  Create an application from a file
-  Use Quick SQL to create database objects
-  Use SQL Developer Web to access database objects
-  Use SQL Developer Web to create a data model
-  Create and modify an APEX application

*Note: This lab assumes you are using Oracle APEX 20.2.*
