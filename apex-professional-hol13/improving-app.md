  ![Click on Delete](./images/delete-home-entry1.png " ")

## Task 2: Set Pages to Public
Your customers don't need to log in to the app to shop for the products, so let's set the following pages as public:
- Page 19: Products
- Page 15: Order Information
- Page 16: Shopping Cart
- Page 17: Add to Cart
- Page 18: Search Customer Order Product Details

Follow these steps for the four listed pages:

1. From the runtime application, navigate to the **Products** page.

    In the Developer Toolbar, click **Edit Page 19**.

    ![Navigate to Page 19](./images/navigate-to-page191.png " ")

2. Within Page Designer, in the Rendering tree (left pane), navigate to  **Page 19: Products**.

    In the Property Editor (right pane), apply the following change:
    - Under the Security section:
        - For Authentication - select **Page Is Public**  

      ![Edit Authentication as Public](./images/edit-page19.png " ")

3. Click **Save**.

4. Navigate to Page Finder and select **Page 15** from the Dialog Page. Repeat steps 2-3.

    ![Navigate to Page finder](./images/navigate-to-page-finder.png " ")

5. Similarly, repeat steps 2-3 for **Page 16: Shopping Cart**, **Page 17: Add to Cart** and **Page 18: Search Customer Order Product Details**.

## Task 3: Remove the Navigation Menu
Since the home page is the Products page and this is a public access page, we do not need a navigation menu.
In this task, you will turn off displaying the navigation menu.

1. Within Page Designer, click the Shared Components icon at the top right.

    ![Click on Shared Components icon](./images/click-sc-icon.png " ")
