# Create Standard Search Configurations

## Introduction
In this lab, you will create two Standard search configurations based on two separate tables.

A search configuration contains information about a searchable data source. In this lab, you create two search configurations and then a search page using the Create Page Wizard. The first search configuration maps to the CUSTOMER_ORDER_PRODUCTS table. The second search configuration maps to the PRODUCT_REVIEWS table.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
- Implement two Search Configurations based on two different tables.
- Create a Search Page using the Create Page Wizard.

2. On the Application home page, click Create Page.

    ![App Builder](images/create-page-sc.png " ")

    > **Note:** _Note: In the Rendering tab, notice the page item, P18\_SEARCH and the Search Results region. P18\_SEARCH is the search field which enables users to submit search terms. The Search Results region contains the search results and two Search Sources, which map to search configurations maintained in Shared Components.
