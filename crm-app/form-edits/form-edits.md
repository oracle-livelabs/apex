Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Enhance Customer and Opportunity Form

## Task 1: Enhancing the Customer Form

Form pages allow end users to readily update a single record of information. It is very common for these pages to be modal pages, whereby they display over the top of the original page, and the original page is greyed out and not accessible without first closing the modal page. Advantages of modal pages include that the same page can be called from numerous other pages, they include all of the processing, validations, and so forth within the page definition, and they are user friendly and make for a very straight forward user experience.

By default, the form pages generated by the Create Application Wizard are modal pages. The modal page for maintaining Customers takes up significant real estate. This could be improved by placing the City, State and Zip on the same line. Also, Email and Phone to be placed on the same line. Lastly, the Longitude and Latitude are not being used, so you should restrict data entry by changing the type to hidden.

1. Click App Builder and Run the CRM Application.
