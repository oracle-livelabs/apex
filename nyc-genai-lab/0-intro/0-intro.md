# Introduction

From precisely summarizing intricate data to crafting context-aware responses, Generative AI stands at the forefront of a technological shift, promising to redefine how we navigate and leverage knowledge in our day-to-day interactions. With the introduction of the native Generative AI Service on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), enabling your applications with generative AI capabilities has never been easier.

In this workshop, you learn to bring generative AI capabilities based on large language models (LLMs) to your applications built using Oracle APEX, your favourite low-code Platform. The Generative AI service can be accessed through REST APIs, and by using the powerful REST Data Source capabilities of APEX, you can effortlessly incorporate this advanced technology into your applications with a low-code approach.

## What is OCI Generative AI service?

[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Generative AI](https://www.oracle.com/artificial-intelligence/generative-ai/large-language-models/) is a fully managed service that provides a set of state-of-the-art, customizable large language models (LLMs) that cover a wide range of use cases for text generation. Generative AI currently supports the following pre-trained foundational models available from Meta and Cohere:

- Llama 2
- Command
- Summarize
- Embed

You can read more about these models from the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/pretrained-models.htm).

This workshop will guide you through the process of utilizing the generation models within the Generative AI Service to develop an "Ask Questions" feature for the New York High Schools APEX application. This functionality empowers parents to inquire about school facilities, policies, and more, aiding them in making an informed decision about whether a specific school is the ideal fit for their child.

Estimated Time: 45 minutes
