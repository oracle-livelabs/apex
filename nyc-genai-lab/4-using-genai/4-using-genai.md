# Build a Conversational Inquiry about Schools using Generative AI

## Introduction

In this lab, you learn to build a conversational inquiry about schools using Generative AI wherein a user can ask questions about a school in chat and the chat widget uses Generative AI to provide context sensitive answers. This lab makes use of the APEX GenAI dynamic action called the **Show AI Assistant**.

**Note:** The screenshots in this workshop are taken using Dark Mode in APEX 24.2

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Create AI Configuration with RAG sources.
- Build a conversational chatbot using Generative AI.


## Task 1: Create the Chat Page

1. Navigate to your application homepage and click **Create Page**. Select **Blank Page**.

    ![App home page](images/create-blank-page.png ' ')

2. In the Create Blank page dialog, enter/select the following:
    - Page Number: **2**
    - Name: **Learn More**
    - Page Mode: **Modal Dialog**

    Click **Create Page**.

    ![create page wizard](images/learn-more.png ' ')

3. With **Page 2: Learn More** selected in the Rendering Tree, enter/select the following in the Property Editor:
    - Appearance > Template Options:
        - General: Check **Remove Body Padding**
        - Content Padding: **Remove Padding**

    ![create page wizard](images/learn-more-template.png ' ')

4. In the rendering tree, under Components, right-click **Content Body** and select **Create Region**.

    ![Page Designer](images/create-region.png ' ')

5. In the Property Editor, enter/select the following:

    - Identification > Name: **Chat**

        ![Page Designer](images/chat-to1.png =40%x*)

    - Under Appearance > Template Options:
        - Under Common:
            - General: Check **Remove Body Padding**
            - Body Height: **320px**
            - Header: **Hidden**
        - Advanced > Bottom Margin: **None**

        ![Page Designer](images/chat-to2.png =50%x*)

    - Advanced > Static ID: **chat**
        ![Page Designer](images/chat-to3.png =40%x*)

    - Click **Save**.

## Task 2: Configure the Prompt Context using AI Configuration

1. Create a Page Item to store the selected School ID. In the Rendering Tree, under Components, right-click **Content Body** and select **Create Page Item**.

    ![Page Designer](images/create-page-item.png ' ')

2. In the Property Editor, enter/select the following:

    - Under Identification:
        - Name: **P2\_SCHOOL\_ID**
        - Type: **Hidden**
        
        Click **Save**.

    ![Page Designer](images/school-id.png ' ')

3. Navigate to Shared Components and select **AI Configurations** under Generative AI.

    ![Page Designer](images/nav-shared-components.png ' ')
    ![Shared components page](images/ai-config.png ' ')

4. Generative AI Configurations contain information such as System Prompt, Welcome Message, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Sources to enable richer interactions with Generative AI services. We create an AI Configuration to store the system prompt for our chat.

    In the Generative AI Configurations page, click **Create**.

    ![Gen AI Configurations page](images/create-ai-config.png ' ')

5. Enter/select the following:
    - Name: **Learn More AI**
    - Service: **Application Default** (If configured, you can also choose other GenAI services from the list)
    - System Prompt: 
    ```
    <copy>
    If the question cannot be answered based on the above context, say "Information Not Found!".
    </copy>
    ```
    - Welcome Message: **Welcome! How may I help you?**

    Click **Create**.

     ![Gen AI Configurations page](images/learn-more-ai-details.png ' ')

6. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Sources are used by the Generative AI Service to improve response quality by providing relevant information.

    Now, let's add a RAG Source to the AI Configuration. Click **Create RAG Source**.

    ![Gen AI Configurations page](images/create-rag-source.png ' ')

7. In the RAG source page, enter/select the following:
    - Name: **School Context**
    - Source > Type: **SQL Query**

    ![RAG Source page](images/rag-details-1.png ' ')
       
8. You will make use of the APEX Assistant to generate the SQL Query for the RAG Source. In the SQL Query code editor, click **APEX Assistant** to open a drawer where you can chat with the AI Assistant. If a dialog box appears to accept the Terms and Conditions, click **Accept**.

    Enter the following prompt in the chat box and click **Send**:

    ```
    <copy>
        Help me create a query that returns only one column concatenating the following information for the HIGHSCHOOLS table. Provide an alias for the column name as prompt_context.

        Please post the description of the column and the value, for example:

        'Overview of the school : '|| OVERVIEW_PARAGRAPH ||chr(10) || chr(13)||


        Overview of the school,
        Language Courses,
        Advanced Placement Courses,
        Diversity in Admission Policy,
        extra curricular activities ,
        Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL) sports for boys,
        Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL) sports for girls,
        facilities,
        Academic opportunities,
        Attendance rate,
        Graduation rate

        filtering by the id of the school

    </copy>
    ```

    ![Page Designer](images/enter-prompt.png ' ')

9. The AI Assistant suggests a SQL Query. You can provide further prompts to refine the query. Once you are happy with the query, click **Insert**.

    ![Page Designer](images/insert-query.png ' ')

10. The SQL query is inserted into the Code Editor. Verify that the *where* condition in the query has ID = **:P2\_SCHOOL\_ID**. Click **Validate**. The SQL query should look like the following:

    ```
    <copy>
        SELECT 'Overview of the school: ' || OVERVIEW_PARAGRAPH || chr(10) || chr(13) ||
       'Language Courses: ' || LANGUAGE_CLASSES || chr(10) || chr(13) ||
       'Advanced Placement Courses: ' || ADVANCED_PLACEMENT_COURSES || chr(10) || chr(13) ||
       'Diversity in Admission Policy: ' || DIADETAILS || chr(10) || chr(13) ||
       'Extra Curricular Activities: ' || EXTRACURRICULAR_ACTIVITIES || chr(10) || chr(13) ||
       'Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL) sports for boys: ' || PSAL_SPORTS_BOYS || chr(10) || chr(13) ||
       'Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL) sports for girls: ' || PSAL_SPORTS_GIRLS || chr(10) || chr(13) ||
       'Facilities: ' || ADDTL_INFO1 || chr(10) || chr(13) ||
       'Academic Opportunities: ' || ACADEMIC_OPPORTUNITIES || chr(10) || chr(13) ||
       'Attendance rate: ' || ATTENDANCE_RATE || chr(10) || chr(13) ||
       'Graduation rate: ' || GRADUATION_RATE as prompt_context
    from HIGHSCHOOLS
    where ID = :P2_SCHOOL_ID;
    </copy>
    ```

    ![Page Designer](images/edit-validate.png ' ')

11. If the validation is successful, click **Create**.
    A RAG source is created successfully. You can add as many RAG Sources as you wish.
