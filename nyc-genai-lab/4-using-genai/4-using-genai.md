# Build a Conversational Inquiry about Schools using Generative AI

## Introduction

In this lab, you learn to build a conversational inquiry about schools using Generative AI wherein a user can ask questions about a school in chat and the chat widget uses Generative AI to provide context sensitive answers. This lab makes use of the latest feature of APEX 24.1 called the **Open AI Assistant**.

**Note:** The screenshots in this workshop are taken using Dark Mode in APEX 24.1.2

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Configure a Generative AI service in your workspace
- Build a conversational chatbot using Generative AI

## Task 1: Configure Generative AI Service

To use the Generative AI service in APEX, you need to first configure it at the workspace level.

1. From the App Builder, navigate to **Workspace Utilities** > **All Workspace Utilities**.

    ![Workspace homepage](images/ws-utilities.png ' ')

2. Select **Generative AI**.

    ![Workspace Utilities page](images/select-genai.png ' ') 

3. Click **Create** to configure a Generative AI Service.

     ![Gen AI services page](images/create-genai.png ' ') 

4. In this workshop, you use OCI Generative AI Service as the AI provider. Enter/select the following:

    - AI Provider: **OCI Generative AI Service**

    ![Page Designer](images/school-id.png ' ')

3. Similarly, repeat step 1 to create another Page Item. Then, enter/select the following in the Property Editor:

    - Under Identification:
        - Name: **P3_CONTEXT**
        - Type: **Hidden**

    ![Page Designer](images/context-item.png ' ')

4. In the Rendering Tree, right-click **P3_CONTEXT** and select **Create Computation**.

        - Type: **SQL Query (return single value)**
        - SQL Query: For the SQL Query, we will make use of the APEX Assistant to generate the query. Follow the next steps to generate the SQL query. Click the **Code Editor** icon.

    ![Page Designer](images/compute-sql.png =40%x*)

6. In the Code Editor, click **APEX Assistant** to open a drawer where you can chat with the AI Assistant. If a dialog box appears to accept the Terms and Conditions, click **Accept**.

    Enter the following prompt in the chat box and click **Send**:

    ```
    <copy>
        Help me create a query that returns only one column concatenating the following information for the HIGHSCHOOLS table. Provide an alias for the column name as prompt_context.

        Please post the description of the column and the value, for example:

        'Overview of the school : '|| OVERVIEW_PARAGRAPH ||chr(10) || chr(13)||


        Overview of the school,
        Language Courses,
        Advanced Placement Courses,

7. The AI Assistant suggests a SQL Query. You can provide further prompts to refine the query. Once you are happy with the query, click **Insert**.

    ![Page Designer](images/insert-query.png ' ')

8. The SQL query is inserted into the Code Editor. Replace *your\_school\_id* with **:P3\_SCHOOL\_ID**. Click **Validate**. The SQL query should look like the following:

    ```
    <copy>
        SELECT 'Overview of the school: ' || OVERVIEW_PARAGRAPH || chr(10) || chr(13) ||
