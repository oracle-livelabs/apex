# Build a Conversational Inquiry about Schools using Generative AI

## Introduction
In this lab, you learn to build a conversational inquiry about schools using Generative AI wherein a user can ask questions about a school in chat and the chat widget uses Generative AI to provide context sensitive answers. This lab makes use of the latest feature of APEX 24.1 called the **Open AI Assistant**.

**Note:** The screenshots in this workshop are taken using Dark Mode in APEX 24.1.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Configure a Generative AI service in your workspace
- Build a conversational chatbot using Generative AI


## Task 1: Configure Generative AI Service
To use the Generative AI service in APEX, you need to first configure it at the workspace level.

1. From the App Builder, navigate to **Workspace Utilities** > **All Workspace Utilities**.

    ![Workspace homepage](images/ws-utilities.png ' ') 

2. Select **Generative AI**.

    ![Workspace Utilities page](images/select-genai.png ' ') 

3. Click **Create** to configure a Generative AI Service.
