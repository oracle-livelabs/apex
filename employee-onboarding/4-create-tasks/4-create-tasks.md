# Create Task Definitions for Employee Onboarding Workflow

## Introduction

In this lab, you will define key Tasks using Oracle APEX’s Tasks Component to support the Employee Onboarding process. These tasks will automate and manage essential actions such as IT setup and training allocation for new employees. You'll configure task details, assign participants dynamically using SQL, define task parameters, and set up automated email reminders based on deadlines.

These task definitions will later be integrated into a complete onboarding workflow.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

* Create a task definition for IT Setup with participant assignment and employee specific actions

* Define a task for Training Allocation with dynamic data source and reminder email setup

* Add participants and parameters for each task

* Configure task deadlines, renewal policies, and notification actions

## Task 1: Create Task Definitions for IT Setup

In this task, you will create a Task Definition for IT Setup and assign it to the IT staff.

1. In your Employee Onboarding Application home page, navigate to **Shared Components**.

    ![Shared Component](images/shared-comps2.png "")

2. Under Workflows and Automations, select **Task Definitions**.

    ![Shared Component Task](images/tasks2.png)

3. Click **Create**.

    ![Create Task Wizard](images/create-task1.png)

4. In the Create Task Definition wizard, enter/select the following:

    - Name: **IT Setup**
    - Type: **Action Task**
    - Subject: **IT Setup Tasks for &EMPLOYEE_NAME.**
    - Priority: **2-High**

    Click **Create**.

    ![Create Task Wizard](images/create-task2.png "")

5. Under **Settings** notice that the Task Details Page Number is empty. Click **Create Task Details Page** button to generate the details page for this task.

   You get a popup dialog asking if the next available page number should be used. Click **OK**.

7. Under **Settings**, enter/select the following:

        ```

        This step ties our task to the system of records, in this case, the employee's records.

    *Note: APEX$TASK\_PK is a substitution string holding the primary key value of the system of records (in this case, the employee's number).*
