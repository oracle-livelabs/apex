# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Manual processes in employee onboarding like tracking approvals, assigning tasks, and following up with departments, can quickly become inconsistent and error prone. With Oracle APEX Workflows, you can bring structure, automation, and visibility to these processes, all within your APEX applications.

Workflows in Oracle APEX enable you to model business processes using a visual editor, define roles and actions, and manage task execution declaratively. These workflows are database driven, integrated into the APEX runtime, and require little to no custom code, making them ideal for business critical flows like onboarding, approvals, procurement, or service requests.

In this hands on workshop, you will build an Employee Onboarding application that uses APEX Workflows to automate and streamline onboarding processes resulting in improved efficiency, reduced manual coordination, and a better new hire experience.

Estimated Workshop Time: 2 hours and 20 minutes.

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

- Build a multi step onboarding process using the Oracle APEX

- Define workflow participants and implement role based task routing.

- Build APEX pages to initiate workflows and complete tasks.

- Automate notifications for onboarding steps.

- Monitor and report on onboarding progress using workflow views.

- Archive Tasks and Workflows.
