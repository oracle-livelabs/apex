# Load Database Objects & Create Workspace Users

## Introduction

This lab walks you through the database objects required for the Employee Onboarding application. This task also shows you how to create multiple workspace users representing different roles within the Employee Onboarding application, enabling you to test various user experiences and access levels for the Workflows.

You'll use SQL scripts to execute a script for creating database objects and inserting data in the tables. This script defines tables, a package and a procedure that will be used for the Employee Onboarding app, including Employees, Departments, Employee Trainings, and more. Once executed, you can review the tables in the Object Browser.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Create Workspace users.

- Load the database objects that are required for this lab using SQL Scripts

### Downloads

If you would like to skip the part of building the app from scratch, download the starter app [here](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/labfiles%2Femp_onboarding_starter_app.sql).

Complete the following steps:

1. Follow on screen instructions to import and install the app with supporting objects.
2. Execute **Lab 2 > Task 1** to create Workspace users.

Then, skip to **Lab 4**.

## Task 1: Create Workspace Users

In this task, you will create multiple **Workspace users** in Oracle APEX to represent different roles for the **Employee Onboarding** application. Defining these users will help you simulate how HR, IT, and Sales employees interact with the application and allow you to test the onboarding workflow from different perspectives.

You will create the following users:

|   Employee Name |  Department |
| -------------- | --------- |
|    STEVE       |   HR  |
|   AMY     |    IT  |
|   ALEX | Sales |
| MONICA | Sales |
{: title="List of Users to Create in the Workspace"}

*Note: MONICA is a new hire in the Sales Department, for whom we will be initating a workflow request.*

1. On the Workspace home page, click **Administration** icon and select **Manage Users and Groups**.

    ![Create Users application](./images/add-users.png " ")

2. Click **Create Multiple Users**.

    ![Create Users application](./images/create-users2.png " ")

3. In the **Create multiple Users**, enter the list of email addresses and set the following attributes:

    - List of Email Addresses: Copy and Paste the below email addresses and replace yourdomain.com with your actual domain.

      ```
      <copy>
      AMY@yourdomain.com
      STEVE@yourdomain.com
      ALEX@yourdomain.com
      MONICA@yourdomain.com
      </copy>
      ```

    - Usernames: **Exclude @ domain as part of the username**

    - Password and Confirm Password: **Enter a password**

    *Note: These users are not Workspace Administrators or Developers, they are End Users and will only have access to the Employee Onboarding application.*

    Click **Next**.

4. Click **Create Valid Users**.

    ![Create Multiple Users - details](./images/create-multiple-users2.png  " ")

## Task 2: Load Database objects

In this task you will use SQL Scripts to quickly load and execute the required database objects including tables, package and procedures. This script defines the database objects for an Employee Onboarding, including  Employees, Departments, Employee Trainings, and more. Once executed, you can review the tables in the Object Browser.

1. Navigate to **SQL Workshop** > **SQL Scripts**.

    ![Workspace Homepage](images/admin-homepage.png " ")

2. Click **Create**.

    ![Create a SQL Script](images/create-script.png " ")

3. In the Script Editor, enter the following:

    - Script Name:  **Employee Onboarding Database objects**

    - Script: Copy and paste the following in the code editor:
