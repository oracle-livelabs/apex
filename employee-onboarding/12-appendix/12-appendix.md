## Task 2: Create Workspace Users

In this task, you will create multiple **Workspace users** in Oracle APEX to represent different roles for the **Employee Onboarding** application. Defining these users will help you simulate how HR, IT, and Sales employees interact with the application and allow you to test the onboarding workflow from different perspectives.

You will create the following users:

|   Employee Name |  Department |
| -------------- | --------- |
|    STEVE       |   HR  |
|   AMY     |    IT  |
|   ALEX | Sales |
| MONICA | Sales |
{: title="List of Users to Create in the Workspace"}

*Note: MONICA is a new hire in the Sales Department, for whom we will be initating a workflow request.*

1. On the Workspace home page, click **Administration** icon and select **Manage Users and Groups**.

    ![Create Users application](./images/add-users.png " ")

2. Click **Create Multiple Users**.

    ![Create Users application](./images/create-users2.png " ")

3. In the **Create multiple Users**, enter the list of email addresses and set the following attributes:

    - List of Email Addresses: Copy and Paste the below email addresses and replace yourdomain.com with your actual domain.

      ```
      <copy>
      AMY@yourdomain.com
      STEVE@yourdomain.com
      ALEX@yourdomain.com
      MONICA@yourdomain.com
      </copy>
      ```

    - Usernames: **Exclude @ domain as part of the username**

    - Password and Confirm Password: **Enter a password**

    *Note: These users are not Workspace Administrators or Developers, they are End Users and will only have access to the Employee Onboarding application.*

    Click **Next**.

    ![Create Multiple Users - details](./images/create-multiple-users.png " ")

4. Click **Create Valid Users**.

    ![Create Multiple Users - details](./images/create-multiple-users2.png  " ")

## Task 3: Create Task Definitions for IT Setup

In this task, you will create a Task Definition for IT Setup and assign it to the IT staff.

1. In your Employee Onboarding Application home page, navigate to **Shared Components**.

        ```

        This step ties our task to the system of records, in this case, the employee's records.
