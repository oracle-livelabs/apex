# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this hands-on lab, you will build a dynamic and interactive application using Oracle APEX AI Assistant. This lab is designed to showcase how AI-driven features of Oracle APEX can accelerate application development and simplify complex tasks, helping you create powerful applications with ease.

You will begin by creating a data model with the assistance of AI, quickly setting up the foundation for your application. Once the data model is ready, you will use the APEX Assistant to build an initial application framework, highlighting how AI can simplify and speed up the development process.

Next, you will customize your application using Oracle APEX low-code features, making adjustments with pre-built components that streamline the enhancement process. You also learn how to generate SQL queries with the help of APEX Assistant, simplifying the creation of complex queries for your application.

As you progress, you integrate AI-powered text generation into your application, enabling it to dynamically create and utilize text content. You will also implement an AI chat assistant by leveraging the Show AI Assistant dynamic Action of APEX of APEX, providing a responsive interface for real-time user interaction.

### Objectives

- Obtain a free development environment.
- Create a Data Model using AI.
- Create an application on the new data structures using APEX Assistant.
- Refine the application by generating SQL using APEX assistant.
- Create an AI Chat Assistant to inquire about the Events.
- Add functionality to Generate Text with AI.

Total Workshop Time: 30 minutes

## Prerequisites

- An APEX workspace.

- API key for the AI Provider of your choice. (OCI Gen AI, Open AI, Cohere)

- If you choose OCI Gen AI as your AI provider, the prerequisites are as follows:

    - A paid Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account or a FREE Oracle Cloud account with $300 credits for 30 days to use on other services. Read more about it at: [oracle.com/cloud/free/](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/). The OCI account must be created in or subscribed to one of the regions that supports OCI Generative AI Service. Currently, OCI Generative AI Service is supported in the following regions:

        - Brazil East (Sao Paulo)
        - Germany Central (Frankfurt)
        - India South (Hyderabad)
        - Japan Central (Osaka)
        - UAE East (Dubai)
        - UK South (London)
        - US Midwest (Chicago)

    - OCI Generative AI service is available in limited regions. To see if your cloud region supports OCI Generative AI service, visit the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/overview.htm#regions).

    - An OCI compartment. An Oracle Cloud account comes with two pre-configured compartments - The tenancy (root compartment) and ManagedCompartmentForPaaS (created by Oracle for Oracle Platform services).

    - The logged-in user should have the necessary privileges to create and manage Autonomous Database instances in this compartment. You can configure these privileges via an OCI IAM Policy. If you are using a Free Tier account, it is likely that you already have all the necessary privileges.

    *Note: This workshop assumes you are using Oracle APEX 24.2 and Oracle Database 23ai. Some of the features might not be available in prior releases and the instructions, flow, and screenshots might differ if you use an older version of Oracle APEX.*
