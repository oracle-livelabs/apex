# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**

Oracle APEX is a feature of Oracle Database, including the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), Autonomous JSON Database (JSON) and APEX Application Development (APEX) services. Oracle APEX is a low-code development environment with various features and tools allowing you to create an application quickly. In the future, rather than emailing spreadsheets to gather information, you will know how to easily create an app in minutes using APEX and email the URL instead. The result will be a secure, scalable, multi-user app that provides a single source-of-truth for your data!

In this lab, you will explore and enhance the appearance and functionality of an Oracle APEX application by creating a custom "Hero" plug-in as a template component and learning how to apply and manage theme styles. Starting with the Theme Roller, you will make a fresh visual style and develop a dynamic and interactive "Hero" component that integrates customizable headers, descriptions, and search elements. Additionally, you will learn how to save, import, export, and reset theme styles, empowering end users to personalize their application experience. This hands-on approach will guide you through designing and deploying custom UI components and enable theme customization capabilities.

### Recap

The last hands-on workshop taught you to configure search configurations and craft a standard search page. Furthermore, you acquired skills in improving your application through the Navigation Bar list, designating your pages as public, and eliminating the navigation menu.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

- Apply a new theme style to enhance the application's visual consistency.

- Create a custom "Hero" plug-in as a template component with configurable attributes and slots.

- Customize the plug-in's appearance and add it as a region within an application page to test its functionality.

- Enable end users to select and switch theme styles, providing a personalized user experience.

- Save, import, export, and reset theme styles for flexible design management.
