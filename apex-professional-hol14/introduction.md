# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**
Oracle APEX is a feature of Oracle Database, including the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), Autonomous JSON Database (JSON) and APEX Application Development (APEX) services. Oracle APEX is a low-code development environment with various features and tools where you can create an application fast. In the future, rather than emailing spreadsheets to gather information, you will know how to easily create an app in minutes using APEX and email the URL instead. The result will be a secure, scalable, multi-user app that provides a single source-of-truth for your data!

In this lab, you use the Theme Roller to save a new Theme Style. Then, you enable end users to apply this style while running the application.

### Recap
In the last hands-on workshop, you learned to configure search configurations and craft a standard search page. Furthermore, you acquired skills in improving your application through the Navigation Bar list, designating your pages as public, and eliminating the navigation menu.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes
