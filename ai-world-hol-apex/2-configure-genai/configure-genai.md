# Configure GenAI in your Tenancy & APEX Workspace

## Introduction

In this Lab we will walk through process of configuring your OCI tenancy and APEX workspace to utilize GenAI. Both the Web Credential and GenAI configuration we create in your APEX Workspace will be available across any APEX application you create in your workspace. 


### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
* Configure Web Credentials in APEX
* Configure Generative AI in APEX

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have the following:

Access to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), paid account or free tier, in a region that has:
Generative AI
Basic experience with OCI Cloud Console and standard components.

## Task 1: Gather your OCI Tenancy Information

1. Navigate to the OCI Cloud Console. Open the Menu in the top left corner and select Identity & Security. Under Identity, select Compartments. Copy the OCID for the compartment you wish to use. 

2. Now click on the top right user icon and select your user (xxx.xxx@xxx.com)
    ![OCI Profile](./images/ociProfile.png  "")

3. Copy down your user OCID
    ![User OCID](./images/userOCID.png  "")

4. Next, select Tokens and Keys tab along the top bar.
    ![Tokens and Keys](./images/tokensAndKeys.png  "")

5. Select Add API Key and select Generate API key pair, ensure you Download Public and Private Key. Then, the Add buton wil be enabled and then click 'Add'

    ![Add API Key](./images/downloadAPIKey.png  "")

6. You can then copy the Fingerprint 

7. Now click on your user in the top right again, this time select your tenancy. 

8. Copy down your Tenancy OCID.

    ![Tenancy OCID](./images/tenancyOCID.png  "")

## Task 2: Configure Web Credntials & Generative AI in your APEX Workspace

1. Now we have all necessary information from your tenancy, you can return to your APEX workspace, if you donâ€™t already have it open. Return to your Autonomous Database, go to Tool Configuration, and open your APEX URL. 

2. Once back in your APEX workspace. Select App Builder, and click Workspace Utilities
    ![Workspace Utilities](./images/workspaceUtilities.png  "")

3. Now select Web Credentials and click Create.
    ![Web Credentials](./images/webCredentials.png  "")

    ![Web Credentials Create](./images/webcredentialsCreate.png  "")

4. From the drop down for 'Authentication Type' select *OCI Native Authentication*. Give your Credentials a name. Then we will use the data we copied from our tenancy in previous steps. Enter your

OCI User ID (User OCID), 
OCI Private Key (downloaded), 
**Note: To enter your Private Key, open the downloaded private key and copy it.**
OCI Tenancy ID (Tenancy OCID) and 
OCI Public Key Fingerprint. 


Then click Create

    ![Credential Details](./images/credentialDetails.png  "")

5. With our Web Credential created, return to Workspace Utilities and select Generative AI. Here we will click Create.
    ![Generative AI](./images/generativeAI.png  "")

    ![Generative AI Create](./images/generativeAICreate.png  "")

6. Select OCI Generative AI Service as the AI Provider. Then enter a name for your Generative AI Configuration. Next you can copy in the Compartment ID from above and select the appropriate region. There will be a default model, or you can choose another from this list. Ensure the model is available in the region you select.

    ![AIProvider OCIGenAIService](./images/aiProviderOCIGenAIService.png  "")

    ![AI Credential](./images/aiCredential.png  "")

7. Enable the Used by App Builder setting if you would like to add a Generative AI option in the Create Application Wizard and include Generative AI support (APEX Assistant) in all APEX Code Editors. Only one Generative AI Service at a time can be configured with the Used by App Builder setting enabled. 

8. Now click Test Connection to ensure it works. With a success, click Create.

You have successfully created your web credential and utilized it to create your Generative AI configuration. You may proceed to the next lab.
