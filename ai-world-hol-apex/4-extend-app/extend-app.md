# Extend your APEX App with Llama or Grok Models.

##  Introduction
In this lab, we’ll enhance the GenAI assistant experience by exploring how to switch between different OCI Generative AI models.  
Different models may perform better depending on your application’s domain — testing them helps you deliver the best user experience.

By the end of this lab, users will have learned how to extend their APEX application by integrating and experimenting with different Generative AI models, such as Llama and Grok. 

Estimated Time: Approximately 15–20 minutes.

###  Objectives
By the end of this lab, you will:
- Learn how to utilize additional LLMs (like Llama or Grok) within your APEX App.

###  Prerequisites
This lab assumes you have:
- Access to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) (paid account or free tier) in a region with Generative AI available.  
- Basic experience** with the OCI Console and APEX components.

## Task 1: Try out Meta Llama Model in your APEX Application 

### Step 1: Explore Available Models to use Llama Model
1. Open the documentation for pre-trained models:  
   [OCI Generative AI Pre-trained Models](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/pretrained-models.htm)  

   ![Metal Llama Models](./images/meta_llama4.png  "Meta Llama 4 model listing in OCI Generative AI")

2. Browse through the list of available models and note the **Model ID** you want to test.  
   Example:  *meta.llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct-fp8*

   [Meta Llama 4 Maverick Model](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/meta-llama-4-maverick.htm#meta.llama-4-maverick:~:text=Model%20Name-,OCI%20Model%20Name,-Pricing%20Page%20Product)

### Step 2: Update Your APEX Application
1. Return to your APEX Workspace, open Workspace Utilities and select Generative AI. Open the Gen AI Service already created.
   ![Generative AI](./images/workspace_gen_ai.png  "APEX Workspace Generative AI service configuration screen")

2. In the ModelID field, replace the old model id with the new one (e.g.)  *meta.llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct-fp8*
   ![Update Model](./images/update_model.png  "Field to update Model ID in your APEX Generative AI service") and test the connection

3. Click Apply Changes to save.  

---

### Step 3: Run and Compare
1. Return to your application in App Builder and select the Movie app.

2. Click Run Application.  

3. Interact with the assistant and observe how it responds. Try the same prompt, which you tried in the previous lab and compare the results.:
   - *I’m in a nostalgic mood and want something heartwarming.*  

   ![Llama Results](./images/cohere_vs_llama.png  "Comparison of responses between Cohere and Llama models")

   You can also try other questions and see how the new model responds back 

   - *I’m feeling adventurous and need something thrilling!*  

    ![Llama Results](./images/llama_results2.png  "Sample results from Llama model after running the APEX app")

Try switching between two models — note differences in:
- **Tone** (formal vs casual)  
- **Detail level** (short vs comprehensive)  
- **Response speed**

## Task 2: Try out Grok Model in your APEX Application 

### Step 1: Explore Available Models to use Grok Model
1. Open the documentation for pre-trained models:  
   [OCI Generative AI Pre-trained Models](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/pretrained-models.htm)  

   ![Grok Models](./images/grok3.png  "Grok-3 model listing in OCI Generative AI")

2. Browse through the list of available models and note the **Model ID** you want to test.  
   Example:  *xai.grok-3*

   [xai.grok-3 Model](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/xai-grok-3.htm#:~:text=Model%20Name-,OCI%20Model%20Name,-Pricing%20Page%20Product)

### Step 1: Update Your APEX Application to use Grok Model
1. Return to your APEX Workspace, open Workspace Utilities and select Generative AI. Open the Gen AI Service already created.
   ![Generative AI](./images/workspace_gen_ai.png  "APEX Workspace Generative AI service configuration screen")

2. In the ModelID field, replace the old model id with the new Grok model (e.g.)  *xai.grok-3*
   ![Update Model Grok](./images/update_model_grok.png  "Field to update Model ID for Grok in your APEX Generative AI service") and test the connection

   *Note: For Grok models are on demand only. (pay-as-you-go usage)*

3. Click Apply Changes to save.  

---

### Step 2: Run and test Grok Model
1. Return to your application in App Builder and select the Movie app.

2. Click Run Application.  

3. Interact with the assistant and observe how it responds. Try the same prompt, which you tried in the previous lab and compare the results.:
   - *I’m in a nostalgic mood and want something heartwarming.*  

   ![Llama Results](./images/grok_results.png  "Sample results from Grok model after running the APEX app")

You’ve successfully extended your APEX app by experimenting with **different LLMs (like Llama and Grok)**.  
This approach allows you to fine-tune the assistant experience based on different model selection.
