# Introduction

## About This Workshop

Are you looking to take advantage of existing Oracle data to create intelligent applications with GenAI? In this hands on Oracle LiveLab, weâ€™ll walk through combining the power and ease of use of Oracle APEX with the intelligence and cutting edge technology of Oracle Generative AI services. Learn how to leverage the power of low-code development to create an APEX application with new or existing data in your Oracle Database, quickly add powerful Generative AI functionality to assist users in querying and utilizing this data, and ***INSERT***.

 

### What is Generative AI? 

Generative AI enables users to quickly generate new content based on a variety 	of inputs. Inputs and outputs to these models can include text, images, sounds, 	animation, 3D models, and other types of data. 

 

 

### What is a GenAI Agent?

### Objectives: 

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Create an Autonomous Databse and Create an APEX Application
* Integrate OCI GenAI into your Application 
* Extend you Application's functionality and Test other LLM's like Grok
By the end of this workshop, you will build a Mood-Based Movie Recommender with GenAI.
 

### Prerequisites

* Your tenancy **must be subscribed to an OCI region with Generative AI service available** see LINK.
* Basic database and SQL knowledge.
* Familiarity with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is helpful.
