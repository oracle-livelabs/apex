# Introduction

## About This Workshop

Are you looking to take advantage of existing Oracle data to create intelligent applications with GenAI? In this hands-on Oracle LiveLab, we’ll show you how to combine the ease of Oracle APEX with the power of Oracle Generative AI services. You'll learn how to leverage the power of low-code development to create an APEX application with new or existing data in your Oracle Database. You can quickly add powerful Generative AI functionality to assist users in querying and utilizing this data, and extend your app further by incorporating models such as Llama and Grok.

### Objectives: 

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Create an Autonomous Database and APEX Workspace  
* Build an APEX Application with database data  
* Integrate OCI GenAI into your Application  
* Extend your Application’s functionality and test other LLMs like Llama and Grok  

By the end of this workshop, you will build a **Mood-Based Movie Recommender with GenAI**.  
 

### Prerequisites

* Your tenancy **must be subscribed to an OCI region with Generative AI service available** (see Oracle documentation for available regions).  
* Basic database and SQL knowledge.  
* Familiarity with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is helpful.  


## Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB)  

### What is Oracle Autonomous Database?  

Oracle Autonomous Database (ADB) is a fully managed, cloud-native database service that uses machine learning to automate routine database tasks such as provisioning, tuning, backups, and patching. With support for both transaction processing and analytics, ADB lets you focus on building applications instead of managing infrastructure.  

For APEX developers, ADB provides a **ready-to-use APEX environment** out of the box — making it the fastest way to start building secure, scalable, low-code applications.

## Oracle APEX  

### What is Oracle APEX?  

Oracle Application Express (APEX) is a low-code development platform built into Oracle Database. It enables you to quickly build scalable, secure web applications with minimal coding effort. With APEX, you can:  

* Create applications directly from database tables or existing data  
* Add dashboards, charts, forms, and reports with drag-and-drop ease  
* Integrate REST APIs, third-party services, and now Generative AI  
* Deliver applications that are mobile-ready and secure by default  

APEX combined with Autonomous Database and OCI services (like GenAI) makes it simple to deliver intelligent, enterprise-grade applications faster.

## Oracle Generative AI (GenAI)  

### What is Generative AI?  

Generative AI enables users to quickly generate new content based on a variety of inputs. Inputs and outputs to these models can include text, images, sounds, animation, 3D models, and other types of data.  

### What is a GenAI Agent?  

A Generative AI (GenAI) agent is an intelligent assistant powered by large language models that can understand natural language, reason, and take actions. In Oracle Cloud, GenAI agents can be embedded into applications (like APEX apps) to answer questions, recommend content, automate tasks, and interact with users naturally.
