# Create an APEX application

## Introduction

In this lab, you will create a new application named **Online Bookstore**. Next, you rapidly design and prototype data models using a markdown-like shorthand syntax that expands to standards-based Oracle SQL known as Quick SQL in Oracle APEX.

**Quick SQL** is designed to reduce the time and effort required to create SQL tables, triggers, and index structures. This tool is not designed to be a replacement for data modeling. Instead, Quick SQL is simply a quick way to develop a script for simple tables and views.

Estimated Time: 4 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Create an APEX Application

- Load Quick SQL

12. All set. Now, run the application and see it in action!

## Task 1: Create an Application

In this lab, you create a simple application with one click called **Online Bookstore**. This option creates an application that contains only a Global page, Home page, and Login page.

1. On the Workspace home page, click the **App Builder**.

   ![App builder home page](./images/go-create-app.png " ")

2. Click **Create** or **Create a New App**.

    ![Create Application options](./images/new-app.png " ")

3. For Name, enter **Online Bookstore** and click **Create application**.

    ![Create Application wizard](./images/create-app1.png " ")

4. To edit application icon, click **Shared Components**.

    ![Create Application wizard](./images/sc-icon.png " ")

5. Under **User Interface**, select **User Interface Attributes**.

    ![Create Application wizard](./images/user-interface.png " ")

6. Click **Change Icon**.

    ![Create Application wizard](./images/change-icon1.png " ")

7. In the Edit Application Icon dialog you can either:
    - **Upload an icon**: Click the plus (+) sign and navigate to the icon, or drag and drop the icon to the Upload your own icon region.

    If you upload a custom icon, it is resized to a number of sizes and will be propagated to the appropriate places at runtime.

    - **Select an icon from the library**: Select the icon color and then the icon.

    In this lab, I uploaded an sample icon from my device. After uploading, it can be adjusted or cropped. Download a sample icon [here](./images/Online_Bookstore_Icon.png).

    After making all changes, click **Save Icon**.

    ![Create Application wizard](./images/upload-icon.png " ")

    ![Create Application wizard](./images/edit-icon.png " ")

8. To view the application, click **Run** and enter your workspace credentials to log in.

     ![Create Application wizard](./images/run-app.png " ")

     ![Create Application wizard](./images/login-app.png " ")

     ![Create Application wizard](./images/home-page.png " ")

## Task 2: Load Quick SQL

In this task, you'll use Quick SQL to quickly generate and execute a script for creating database tables. This script defines tables for an Online Bookstore app, including Users, Books, Orders, and more. Once executed, you can review the tables in the Object Browser.

1. Navigate to selectÂ **SQL Workshop** and select **Utilities > Quick SQL**.

    ![Create Application wizard](./images/quick-sql.png " ")

2. Copy and paste the given code in the Quick SQL column and click **Review and Run**.

    ```
