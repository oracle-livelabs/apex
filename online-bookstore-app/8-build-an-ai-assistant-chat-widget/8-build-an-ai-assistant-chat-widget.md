# Build an AI-Assistant Chat Widget

## Introduction

In this lab, you use OCI Generative AI as the AI provider to build a conversational chatbot. To use the OCI Generative AI Service in APEX, you need to configure the OCI API keys. In Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), API keys are used for secure authentication when accessing OCI resources through REST APIs.

OCI API keys consist of two parts: a **Public key** and a **Private key**. You use the OCI console to generate the Private/Public key pair.

**Note:** OCI Generative AI service is available in limited regions. To see if your cloud region supports OCI Generative AI service, visit the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/overview.htm#regions).

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Generate API Keys using OCI Console
- Create Web Credentials in Oracle APEX
- Configure Generative AI Service
- Create AI Configurations
- Create RAG Data Sources
- Create a Navigation Bar Entry

### Downloads: Missed Previous Labs? Download and Install the Application

If you're stuck or missed out on completing the previous labs, don't worry! Click [here](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/obs-lab7.zip) to download the export file, which contains everything completed in the previous labs. To run the app, follow the steps described in the [Lab Appendix: Download Instructions](?lab=download-instructions) from Task 2 to Task 3.

## Task 1: Generate API Keys using OCI Console

Note: If you already have an OCI key pair, you may skip this lab.

To Generate the API Keys using OCI Console:

1. Login into your OCI Account.

   ![Add API Key](images/oci-login.png " ")

2. Click **My profile** at the top-right corner.

    ![Profile Menu](images/profile.png " ")

3. Under Resources at the bottom-left, select **API keys** and  click **Add API key**.

    ![Add API Key](images/api-keys.png " ")

4. The Add API key dialog is displayed. Select **Generate API key pair** to create a new key pair.

5. Click **Download private key**. A *.pem* file is saved to your local device. You do not need to download the public key.

   *Note: You will use this private key while configuring the web credentials in Oracle APEX in the upcoming lab.*

6. Click **Add**.

    ![Profile Menu](images/add-api-key.png " ")

7. The key is added, and the Configuration file preview is displayed. Copy and save the configuration file snippet from the text box into a notepad. You will use this information for creating Oracle APEX Web Credentials.

    ![Profile Menu](images/configuration-preview.png " ")

## Task 2: Create Web Credentials

Web credentials are used to authenticate connection to external REST services, or REST Enabled SQL services from APEX.

Creating Web Credentials securely stores and encrypts authentication credentials for use by Oracle APEX components and APIs. Credentials cannot be retrieved back in clear text. Credentials are stored at the workspace level and therefore are visible to all applications.

To create a Web Credential in Oracle APEX:

1. Login into your Oracle APEX workspace.

   ![Login into your APEX account](images/apex-login.png " ")

2. On the Workspace home page, click **App Builder**.

   ![Click App Builder](images/app-build.png " ")

3. Click **Workspace Utilities**.

   ![Click Workspace Utilities](images/workspace-utilities.png " ")

4. Select **Web Credentials**.

   ![Click Web Credentials](images/sc-web-creds.png " ")

5. Click **Create**.

   ![Create Web Credentials](images/create-wc.png " ")

6. Enter the following details using the configuration file you copied in the previous task.

    - **Name**: apex\_ai\_cred

    - **Authentication Type**: OCI Native Authentication

    - **OCI User ID**: Enter the OCID of the Oracle Cloud user Account. You can find the OCID in the Configuration File Preview generated during the API Key creation.
    Your OCI User ID looks similar to **ocid1.user.oc1..aaaaaaaa\*\*\*\*\*\*wj3v23yla**

    - **OCI Private Key**: Open the private key (.pem file) downloaded in the previous task. Copy and paste the API Key.

      ![Private key file](images/private-key.png " ")

    - **OCI Tenancy ID**: Enter the OCID for Tenancy. Your Tenancy ID looks similar to **ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaaf7ush\*\*\*\*cxx3qka**

    - **OCI Public Key Fingerprint**: Enter the Fingerprint ID. Your Fingerprint ID looks similar to **a8:8e:c2:8b:fe:\*\*\*\*:ff:4d:40**

   ![Web Credentials page](images/web-creds.png " ")

7. Click **Create**.

## Task 3: Configure Generative AI Service
