## Prerequisites

- An APEX workspace.

- We need to use an OCI API key for Lab 14. For this, a paid Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account or a FREE Oracle Cloud account with $300 in credits (valid for 30 days) is required. These credits can be used for other services. Read more about it at: [oracle.com/cloud/free/](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/free/). 

- We need to use an API key for the AI Provider of your choice (OCI Generative AI, Open AI, Cohere) for Labs 8, and 17.

- In this LiveLab, OCI Generative AI is the chosen AI provider. The prerequisites are as follows:

    - The OCI account must be created in or subscribed to a region that supports the OCI Generative AI Service. Currently, the OCI Generative AI Service is available in the following regions:

        - US Midwest (Chicago)
        - Germany Central (Frankfurt)
        - UK South (London)
        - Brazil East (Sao Paulo)
        - Japan Central (Osaka)

    - OCI Generative AI service is available in limited regions. To see if your cloud region supports OCI Generative AI service, visit the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/generative-ai/overview.htm#regions).

    - An OCI compartment. An Oracle Cloud account comes with two pre-configured compartments - The tenancy (root compartment) and ManagedCompartmentForPaaS (created by Oracle for Oracle Platform services).

    - The logged-in user should have the necessary privileges to create and manage Autonomous Database instances in this compartment. You can configure these privileges via an OCI IAM Policy. If you are using a Free Tier account, it is likely that you already have all the necessary privileges.

>*Note: This workshop assumes you are using Oracle APEX 24.2.*

- *Some of the features might not be available in prior releases and the instructions, flow, and screenshots might differ if you use an older version of Oracle APEX.*

- *Lab 18 requires Oracle Database 23ai.*

- *The screenshots in this workshop are taken using Dark Mode in APEX 24.2*

- *The application icon in the screenshots may vary. Please ignore the application icon.*
