# Migrate Application Development Between Environments

## Introduction

In this lab, You will create Installation scripts and Data Packages to export Database objects along with Data. Then you will export the **DEMO PROJECTS** Application along with supporting objects and import it into another workspace.

In the second part of the lab, You will be using Remote Deployment to deploy your Application from Development to UAT. The ORDS feature, **REST Enabled SQL** is not available for **apex.oracle.com** users. Therefore, you will not be able to perform this lab in the hosted instance apex.oracle.com. You should be using **APEX Service** or **APEX on Autonomous Database** options for this lab.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes


Estimated Time: 20 minutes


### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Create Installation Scripts
- Create Data Packages
- Export application with supporting Objects.
- Use Remote Deployment to deploy your Application.

### Downloads

- Did you miss out on trying the previous labs? Donâ€™t worry! You can download the application from **[here](files/demo-projects5.sql)** and import it into your workspace. To run the app, please run the steps described in **[Get Started with Oracle APEX](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/run-workshop?p210_wid=3509)** and **[Using SQL Workshop](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/run-workshop?p210_wid=3524)** workshops.

## Task 2: Importing Application into the Target Workspace and Verify Database Objects.

In this Lab, You will login into a new workspace or the Workspace you created in previous labs and import the application along with Supporting objects.
