# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**

Oracle APEX is a feature of Oracle Database, including the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), Autonomous JSON Database (JSON), and APEX Application Development (APEX) services. Oracle APEX is a low-code development environment with various features and tools where you can create an application fast. In the future, rather than emailing spreadsheets to gather information, you will know how to easily create an app in minutes using APEX and email the URL instead. The result will be a secure, scalable, multi-user app that provides a single source-of-truth for your data!

Oracle APEX allows developers to create Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) that can be easily installed on any desktop or mobile device, offering users a more native app experience. This application is a valuable reference for developers looking to incorporate key PWA features into their applications, helping them create more engaging and user-friendly apps.

In this lab, You will make the **Demo Projects** app installable on any device. You also implement a 'Share' button where a user can share the uploaded images with other users via email or 3rd party apps. Finally, you add mobile capabilities to the app by enabling Push Notifications for the Demo Projects App. You also learn to add Shortcuts and Screenshots to the PWA app.

Estimated Time: 35 minutes
