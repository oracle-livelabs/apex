# Create the Items Form

## Introduction

In this lab, you will learn how to create a form for managing items, ensure proper validation of user inputs, implement dynamic actions to enhance user interaction, and create processes to automate backend tasks. By completing these tasks, you will gain hands-on experience in building a functional and user-friendly application interface using Oracle APEX.

Estimated Time: 10 Minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you:

- Configure the form to interact with the S_ITEM table.
- Implement a dynamic action to automatically set the product price based on the selected product ID.
- Develop a process to automate the retrieval of the item ID.

## Task 1: Create the Items Form

1. Click **Application ID** to go to the application home page.

    ![App Builder](images/navigate-to-appid.png " ")

2. Click **Create Page**.

    ![App Builder](images/create-form-page.png " ")

3. Select **Form**.

    ![App Builder](images/select-form.png " ")

4. On **Create Form** wizard, enter/select the following:

    - Page Number: **7**

    - Name: **Item - Details**

    - Page Mode: **Drawer**

    - Table/View Name: **S_ITEM**

    Click **Next**.

   ![App Builder](images/item-details.png " ")

5. Under Primary Key:

    - Primary Key Column 1: **ORD\_ID (Number)**

    - Primary Key Column 2: **ITEM\_ID (Number)**

     Click **Create Page**.

    ![App Builder](images/item-detail-key.png " ")

## Task 2: Create Validations

The S_ITEM table has five columns required: ORD\_ID, ITEM\_ID, PRODUCT\_ID, PRICE, and QUANTITY. You must ensure that end-users enter or select a value for these items.

1. In the left pane, select **Items - Details** region and expand the columns. While holding down the Ctrl key, click the columns: P7\_PRODUCT\_ID, P7\_PRICE, and P7\_QUANTITY.

    ![App Builder](images/item-details-page.png " ")

2. In the property editor, apply the following changes:

    - Appearance > Template: **Required - Floating**

    - Validation > Value Required: **Toggle On**

   ![App Builder](images/select-items1.png " ")

## Task 3: Create a Dynamic Action

1. Navigate to **Item - Details** region, select **P7\_PRODUCT\_ID**, right-click and select **Create Dynamic Action**.

    ![App Builder](images/create-dynamic-actions1.png " ")

2. In the property editor, under Identification > Name: enter **Get Product Price**.

    ![App Builder](images/get-product-price1.png " ")

3. Navigate to the **Show** action,  and enter/select the following:

    - Identification > Action: **Set Value**

    - Under Settings:

        - Set Type: **PL/SQL Function Body**

        - PL/SQL Function Body: Copy and paste the below code:

         ```
         <copy>
         return PKG_MODERNIZATION.F_GET_PRODUCT_PRICE(p_product_id => :P7_PRODUCT_ID);
         </copy>
        ```

        - Items to submit: **P7\_PRODUCT\_ID**

    - Affected Elements > Item(s): **P7\_PRICE**

    ![App Builder](images/set-value1.png " ")

## Task 4: Create a Process

1. Navigate to the **Processing** tab and right-click **Processes** and select **Create Process**.

    ![App Builder](images/create-process1.png " ")

2. In the property editor, enter/select the following:

    - Under Identification:

        - Name: **Get Item Id**

        - Type: **Invoke API**

    - Under the Settings:

        - Package: **PKG\_MODERNIZATION**

        - Procedure or Function: **F\_GET\_ITEM\_ID**

    - Under the Server-side Condition:

        - Type: **Item is NULL**

        - Item: **P7\_ITEM\_ID**

   ![App Builder](images/get-item-id1.png " ")

3. Under **Get Item Id** process, navigate to **Parameters**, and click **Function Result**. Update the following:

    - Value > Item: **P7\_ITEM\_ID**

   ![App Builder](images/function-result1.png " ")

4. Click **p\_ord\_id**, and verify this information:

    - Value > Type: Item

    - Value > Item: **P7\_ORD\_ID**

    ![App Builder](images/p-ord-id.png " ")

5. This new process should be the first process to be executed, drag and drop it before **Process from Item - Details**.

    ![App Builder](images/drag-process1.png " ")

5. Lastly, navigate to **Rendering** tab, organize the items in the layout by dragging and dropping the items as per your preference and click **Save**.

    ![App Builder](images/drag-item1.png " ")

## Summary

In this lab, you created a functional form for managing items in Oracle APEX by configuring it to interact with the 'S\_ITEM' table. You implemented necessary validations to ensure required fields are completed by users and created a dynamic action to automatically set the product price based on the selected product ID using PL/SQL. Additionally, you developed a process to automate the retrieval of the item ID, ensuring it runs conditionally when the item ID is null. These tasks enhanced our skills in building user-friendly and efficient application interfaces.
