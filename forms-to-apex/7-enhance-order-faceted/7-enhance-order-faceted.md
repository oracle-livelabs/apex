# Enhance the Orders Faceted Search Page

## Introduction

Let's recap what you have built so far for the orders form. In Lab 4, you created a faceted search and a form page to manage the orders. In this lab, you will enhance these pages and link it to the orders page you created.

Please note that other options you can create are available in the wizard:

- Option 1 - Master Detail - Stacked
- Option 2 - Master Detail - Side by Side
- Option 3 - Master Detail - Drill Down

Run this [Sample App](https://apex.oracle.com/go/forms2apex-app) to see the above options.

Estimated Time: 5 Minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you:

- Remove an unnecessary facet from the orders faceted search page.
- Rename and customize the orders report region.
- Configure the ID column to link to the Order Details page.
- Create a button to facilitate creating new orders and link it to the order details page.

## Task 1: Enhance the Orders Faceted Search Page

The faceted search page was created with four facets:

- Sales Representative
- Customer
- Payment Type
- Order Filled

Since order filled is not a key facet search, let's remove it by following these steps:

1. Navigate to the page finder and select the **Orders - Faceted Search**.

2. In the left pane, select **Search** region. Right-click **P5\_ORDER\_FILLED** and click **Delete**.

    ![App Builder](images/del-ord-filled.png " ")

3. Now, navigate to the **Ord** region. In the property editor, update the following:

    - Identification > Name: **Orders Report**

    - Under Source:

        - Type: **SQL Query**

        - SQL Query: Copy and paste the below SQL query

    ```
    <copy>
    SELECT id,
       customer_id,
       date_ordered,
       date_shipped,
       sales_rep_id,
       (SELECT Sum(i.price * i.quantity)
        FROM   s_ord o
               JOIN s_item i
                 ON o.id = i.ord_id
        WHERE  o.id = s_ord.id) TOTAL,
       payment_type,
       order_filled
       FROM   s_ord;
    </copy>
    ```

    - Under Appearance:

        - Click **Template Options** : Header > **Visible: Default**

        Click **OK**.

    ![App Builder](images/ords-report.png " ")

    ![App Builder](images/order-report-region1.png " ")

4. Expand the columns of the **Orders Report** region. Click the **ID** column and update the following:

    - Identification > Type: **Link**

    - Under Link:

        - Target > click **No Link Defined**

             - Page: **6**

             - Set Items > Name: **P6\_ID**, Value: **#ID#**

             - Clear Cache: **6**

            Click **OK**.

    ![App Builder](images/link.png " ")

5. Click the **TOTAL** column and update the following:

    - Appearance > Format Mask: **FML999G999G999G999G990D00**

    ![App Builder](images/total-column.png " ")

6. Right-click **Orders Report** region and select **Create Button**.

    ![App Builder](images/create-btn.png " ")

7. In the property editor, enter/select the following:

    - Identification > Button Name: **NEW_ORDER**

    - Layout > Slot: **Edit**

    - Appearance > Hot: **Toggle On**

    - Under Behavior:

        - Action: **Redirect to Page in this Application**

        - Target: click **No Link Defined**

            - Page: **6**

            - Clear Cache: **6**

            Click **OK**.

    ![App Builder](images/new-order-btn.png " ")

    ![App Builder](images/redirect-btn1.png " ")

8. Click **Save**.

## Summary

In this lab, you learned how to enhance the orders faceted search page by removing non-essential facets and improving the overall functionality and appearance. Additionally, you configured the ID column to act as a link to another page and created a button for easy navigation to the order creation page.
