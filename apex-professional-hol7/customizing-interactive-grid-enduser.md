### Objectives

## Task 1: Customize interactive grid as an end-user.
In this lab, you use and customize the display of your interactive grid. You also edit an editable interactive grid.

1. Notice that the interactive grid is editable now. You see the Edit, Save, and Add Row buttons. Also, the pagination type that you have set is displayed now. Perform a non-case-sensitive search for ‘**server**’ on the entire interactive grid.  
To do this, enter **server** in the search bar text area and click **Go**.
