# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**

Oracle APEX is a low-code application platform for Oracle Database. APEX Application Development, Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), and Autonomous JSON Database are fully managed services, pre-integrated and pre-configured with APEX, for rapidly building and deploying modern data-driven applications in Oracle Cloud. Business users, citizens, and application developers can create enterprise apps 20X faster with 100X less code â€” without learning complex web technologies with just a browser.
