# Create the Web Credentials

## Introduction

In this lab, you learn to create web credentials in Oracle APEX using the OCI API keys. In Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), API keys are used for secure authentication when accessing OCI resources through REST APIs. 

Web credentials are used to authenticate connection to external REST services, or REST Enabled SQL services from APEX.

Creating Web Credentials securely stores and encrypts authentication credentials for use by Oracle APEX components and APIs. Credentials cannot be retrieved back in clear text. Credentials are stored at the workspace level and therefore are visible to all applications.


Estimated Time: 10 Minutes

### Objectives

6. Enter the following details using the configuration file you copied in the previous task.

    - **Name**: apex\_ai\_cred

    - **Authentication Type**: OCI Native Authentication

    - **OCI User ID**: Enter the OCID of the Oracle Cloud user Account. You can find the OCID in the zip folder you downloaded as part of prerequisites.
    Your OCI User ID looks similar to **ocid1.user.oc1..aaaaaaaa\*\*\*\*\*\*wj3v23yla**

    - **OCI Private Key**: Open the private key (.pem file) downloaded in the previous task. Copy and paste the API Key.

    - **OCI Tenancy ID**: Enter the OCID for Tenancy. Your Tenancy ID looks similar to **ocid1.tenancy.oc1..aaaaaaaaf7ush\*\*\*\*cxx3qka**

    - **OCI Public Key Fingerprint**: Enter the Fingerprint ID. Your Fingerprint ID looks similar to **a8:8e:c2:8b:fe:\*\*\*\*:ff:4d:40**
