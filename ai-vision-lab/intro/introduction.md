## About this Workshop

In today's data-driven world, the ability to extract valuable insights from visual content has become a game-changer for businesses across industries. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in the field of computer vision, enabling machines to understand and interpret visual data with remarkable accuracy.

In this workshop, you learn how OCI Vision is used to enhance the Oracle APEX Social Media app for the classification of images. By integrating OCI Vision with Oracle APEX, businesses can tap into the power of visual intelligence, transforming their data analysis capabilities and revolutionizing user experiences.

Estimated Time: 1 hour
