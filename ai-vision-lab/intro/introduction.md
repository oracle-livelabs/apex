# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In today's data-driven world, the ability to extract valuable insights from visual content has become a game-changer for businesses across industries. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in the field of computer vision, enabling machines to understand and interpret visual data with remarkable accuracy.

In this workshop, you learn to enhance the Oracle APEX Social Media app with OCI Vision for the classification of images. By integrating OCI Vision with Oracle APEX, businesses can tap into the power of visual intelligence, transforming their data analysis capabilities and revolutionizing user experiences.

Estimated Time: 1 hour

### Objectives
In this workshop, you:

- Enhance Social Media App with AI-Powered Search.
- Integrate APEX with OCI using API keys.
- Seamlessly link APEX with OCI Vision Service through REST Data Sources.

### Prerequisites for Building this App:

- A paid Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) account or a FREE Oracle Cloud account with $300 credits for 30 days to use on other services. Read more about it at: https://www.oracle.com/in/cloud/free/

- An OCI compartment. An Oracle Cloud account comes with two pre-configured compartments - The tenancy (root compartment) and ManagedCompartmentForPaaS (created by Oracle for Oracle Platform services).

- The logged-in user should have the necessary privileges to create and manage Autonomous Database instances in this compartment. You can configure these privileges via an OCI IAM Policy. If you are using a Free Tier account, it is likely that you already have all the necessary privileges.
