# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**

Oracle APEX is a low-code application platform for Oracle Database. APEX Application Development, Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), and Autonomous JSON Database are fully managed services, pre-integrated and pre-configured with APEX, for rapidly building and deploying modern data-driven applications in Oracle Cloud. Business users, citizens, and application developers can create enterprise apps 20X faster with 100X less code - without learning complex web technologies with just a browser.

In this workshop, you explore and review the Page Designer in APEX. Then, you create a new page in the Online Shopping Application that allows customers to view the details of their recent order.

Once the page is created, customers will be able to view the following details of the order in the app:

- Order number
- Order date
- Status
- Total price
- Quantity and price of the items.

### Recap

In the preceding workshop, you learned to create an application using your installed tables and data. Also, you created a Database application from a file, created an application from a Spreadsheet and configured a Progressive Web Application.

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:

- Navigate and Review the Page Designer panes.

- Create a page to review the items that the customer bought.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

> **Note:** _Note: This workshop assumes you are using Oracle APEX 24.2_
