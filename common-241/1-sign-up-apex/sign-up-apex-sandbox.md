### What is an APEX Workspace?

An APEX Workspace is a logical domain where you define APEX applications. Each workspace is associated with one or more database schemas (database users) which are used to store the database objects, such as tables, views, packages, and more. APEX applications are built on top of these database objects.

## Create an APEX Service Instance


1.  From the Oracle Cloud Dashboard, click on the hamburger menu on the upper-left corner. From the navigation menu, select **Developer Services** and then **APEX Application Development** or **APEX Instances**. The APEX Instances page appears.

5. Before using a new APEX Service, you must set up your APEX Service instance by completing two tasks: create an initial APEX workspace and create an APEX user account.

    On the APEX Instance Details, click **Launch APEX**.
