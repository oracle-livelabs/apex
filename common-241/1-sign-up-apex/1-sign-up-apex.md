# Sign up for an APEX Workspace

## Introduction

Oracle APEX is a low-code application platform for Oracle Database. APEX Application Development, Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), and Autonomous JSON Database are fully managed services, pre-integrated and pre-configured with APEX, for rapidly building and deploying modern data-driven applications in Oracle Cloud. Business users, citizen, and application developers can create enterprise apps 20X faster with 100X less code â€” without having to learn complex web technologies with just a browser. To start with, you will need to decide on the service you are going to use for this workshop, and then create an APEX workspace accordingly. Continue reading further to learn which is the best service for you!

If you already have an APEX 24.1 Workspace provisioned, you can skip this lab.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk through of the lab.

### What is an APEX Workspace?

An APEX Workspace is a logical domain where you define APEX applications. Each workspace is associated with one or more database schemas (database users) which are used to store the database objects, such as tables, views, packages, and more. APEX applications are built on top of these database objects.

### How Do I Find My APEX Release?

To determine which release of Oracle APEX you are currently running, do one of the following:

- View the **release number** on the Workspace home page:
  - Sign in to Oracle APEX. The Workspace home page appears. The current release version displays at the bottom right corner.

    ![APEX Workspace home page](images/release-number.png " ")
    ![APEX release number](images/release-number2.png " ")

- View the **About Oracle APEX** page:
  - Sign in to Oracle APEX. The Workspace home page appears.
  - Click the **Help** menu at the top of the page and select **About**. The **About Oracle APEX** page appears.

### Where to Run the Lab

You can run this lab in any Oracle Database with APEX 24.1 installed. This includes the new APEX Application Development Service, the Oracle Autonomous Database, the free, "Development Only" apex.oracle.com service, your on-premises Oracle Database (providing APEX 24.1 is installed), on a third party cloud provider where APEX 24.1 is installed, or even on your laptop by installing Oracle XE or Oracle VirtualBox App Dev VM and installing APEX 24.1.

Below are steps on how to sign up for either an *APEX Application Development* Service, an *Oracle Autonomous Database* cloud service or *apex.oracle.com* service.

- The APEX Application Development Service is great if you would like to go with a flexible paid option that allows to concentrate your efforts on APEX development without worrying about the database management. It provides 1 OCPU and 1 TB and can be extended as needed.
- The Always Free Oracle Autonomous Database option is ideal for learning about the Oracle Database and APEX, and provides 1 OCPU and 20 GB of compressed storage. This service can also be utilized for production applications, and can readily be upgraded to a paid service as necessary.
- On the other hand, apex.oracle.com is also a free service; however, it is only designated for evaluation purposes, and running production apps is not allowed.

For conducting labs in this workshop, either service can be utilized.
