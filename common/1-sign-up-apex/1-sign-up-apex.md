# Sign up for an APEX Workspace

## Introduction

Oracle APEX is a low-code application platform for Oracle Database. APEX Application Development, Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), and Autonomous JSON Database are fully managed services, pre-integrated and pre-configured with APEX, for rapidly building and deploying modern data-driven applications in Oracle Cloud. Business users, citizen, and application developers can create enterprise apps 20X faster with 100X less code â€” without having to learn complex web technologies with just a browser. To start, you will need to decide on the service you are going to use for this workshop, and then create an APEX workspace accordingly. Continue reading further to learn which is the best service for you!

If you already have an APEX 22.1 Workspace provisioned, you can skip this lab.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk through of the lab.

### What is an APEX Workspace?
An APEX Workspace is a logical domain where you define APEX applications. Each workspace is associated with one or more database schemas (database users) which are used to store the database objects, such as tables, views, packages, and more. APEX applications are built on top of these database objects.

### How Do I Find My APEX Release?
To determine which release of Oracle APEX you are currently running, do one of the following:
* View the release number on the Workspace home page:
    - Sign in to Oracle APEX. The Workspace home page appears. The current release version displays in bottom right corner.

    ![](images/release-number.png " ")
    ![](images/release-number2.png " ")

* View the About APEX page:
    - Sign in to Oracle APEX. The Workspace home page appears.
    - Click the Help menu at the top of the page and select About. The About APEX page appears.

### Where to Run the Lab
You can run this lab in any Oracle Database with APEX 22.1 installed. This includes the new APEX Application Development Service, the Oracle Autonomous Database, the free, "Development Only" apex.oracle.com service, your on-premises Oracle Database (providing APEX 22.1 is installed), on a third party cloud provider where APEX 22.1 is installed, or even on your laptop by installing Oracle XE or Oracle VirtualBox App Dev VM and installing APEX 22.1.

Below are steps on how to sign up for either an *APEX Application Development* Service, an *Oracle Autonomous Database* cloud service or *apex.oracle.com* service.
- The APEX Application Development Service is great if you would like to go with a flexible paid option that allows to concentrate your efforts on APEX development without worrying about the database management. It provides 1 OCPU and 1 TB and can be extended as needed.
- The Always Free Oracle Autonomous Database option is ideal for learning about the Oracle Database and APEX, and provides 1 OCPU and 20 GB of compressed storage. This service can also be utilized for production applications, and can readily be upgraded to a paid service as necessary.
- On the other hand, apex.oracle.com is also a free service; however, it is only designated for development purposes, and running production apps is not allowed.

For conducting labs in this workshop, either service can be utilized.

*Note*: Except for the Spreadsheet lab, which has been updated to use APEX 22.1, the remaining APEX workshops currently contain steps/screenshots for 21.2 or earlier. While we are working hard to update the workshops to 22.1 (the latest release), you can continue to refer to the steps in the workshop. Some of the steps may differ.

Click one of the options below to proceed.

## **Option 1**: APEX Service
Oracle Application Development (APEX Service) is a low cost Oracle Cloud service offering convenient access to the Oracle APEX platform. Visit [https://apex.oracle.com/en/platform/apex-service/](https://apex.oracle.com/en/platform/apex-service/) to learn more about APEX service on Oracle Cloud.

In this part, you will create an Oracle APEX Application Development Service trial account. Once you have signed up for the service, you will create an *APEX Service*. The final step in the process is to provision Oracle APEX.

1.  Please [click this link to create your free account](https://signup.cloud.oracle.com/). When you complete the registration process, you'll receive an account with a $300 credit that you can utilize to create an APEX Service. You can then use any remaining credit to continue to explore the Oracle Cloud.

2.  Once the Signup process is complete, you will be logged in automatically to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) Console.
    -  In case you have closed the browser, you can always refer to the **Get Started Now with Oracle Cloud** email that you should have received to login to OCI Console.   
    Make a note of your **Username**, **Password**, and **Cloud Account Name**.

        ![](images/get-started-email.png " ")

    - Alternatively, you can login to your Oracle Cloud account by accessing the following URL from your browser:       
    [https://cloud.oracle.com](https://cloud.oracle.com)

        Enter your **Cloud Account Name** in the input field and click the **Next** button.
