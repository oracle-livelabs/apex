# Introduction
## About this Workshop
In this workshop, you will build a mobile-friendly Movie Watchlist app that you and your friends can use to search for movies and add them to your own personal movie watchlists.  

The app will source data from [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/), an online community-based database with metadata for thousands of movies and TV shows, and an extensive API.  

The workshop is organized into a total of ten labs, with the last two being optional. First, you will get your APEX environment and set up an API key on TMDB. Then, you will create REST Data Sources in APEX to connect to TMDB, and begin developing!  

It will take about two hours to complete the workshop, but your time may vary depending on your experience with APEX. If you get stuck, don't worry! At the end of each lab, you will find an app export that will get you across the finish line.  

Upon completing this workshop, you will have your very own simple movies watchlist app that is fun and easy to use! From there, you can continue to enhance this app by applying the concepts and techniques you learned. For example, you can use the Star Rating item to rate a movie once its been watched, or show which streaming providers have the movie using TMDB's rich API. The possibilities are endless, and you'll be fully prepared for your next movie night!  

Estimated Workshop Time: 2 hours

*Note: This lab assumes you are using Oracle APEX 21.1.*
