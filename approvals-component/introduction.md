# Build an Expense Tracker Application using Oracle APEX

# Introduction

This workshop introduces the Approvals Component in Oracle APEX, a new feature released with APEX 22.1. You learn the concepts and terms associated with Approval Management in APEX by building an Expense Tracker Application that allows you to manage expenses in your department.

To apply for an expense, an employee logs into the application and submits an expense request by filling in the details such as Type (Accommodation/Conference/Internet/ Miscellaneous Expenses) and total Expenses. The task could be assigned to multiple potential owners, and the owner can perform one of the appropriate actions (Request information/Delegate/Release/Change Priority).

In a typical use case of a multi-level approval, if the expense cost is more than 50000, the Expense request once approved by the immediate manager, will go to the next manager and so on, depending on the Expense amount. 

Further, a task can have a Deadline and an Expiration date. The potential owner receives an Email 5 mins before the expiration of a task. If the task is not Approved or Rejected before the expiration date, then the task could be tagged as Expired.

Estimated Time: 1 hour
