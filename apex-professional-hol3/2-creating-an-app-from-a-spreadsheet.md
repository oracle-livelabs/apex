# Create an App from a Spreadsheet

## Introduction

In this lab, you will create a simple application using Oracle APEX based on data from a spreadsheet. Oracle APEX simplifies the app creation process, whether you're working with spreadsheets, local database objects, REST-enabled SQL services, or APIs. This lab also introduces you to key features like application restoration using blueprints and configuring Progressive Web App (PWA) attributes.

While APEX developers spend the majority of their time in the App Builder, you should also investigate the SQL Workshop, where you can create and maintain database objects, Team Development, where you can track large APEX development projects, and the App Gallery, which contains numerous productivity and sample apps that can be installed within minutes.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Create an application from a spreadsheet.

- Restore a deleted application using a load blueprint.

- Configure Progressive Web App.

## Task 1: Load Project data

In this task, you will start by loading data from a spreadsheet into Oracle APEX. You will use the "Create App From a File" option to upload and process a sample file containing project data. This will help you create a database table and populate it with the provided records, setting the foundation for the application.

1. On your APEX workspace home page, select **App Builder** and click **Create**.

    ![Create Application](images/create-app1.png " ")

2. Select **Create App From a File**.

    ![Create application from a file](images/from-a-file.png " ")

    When creating an application from a file, APEX allows you to upload CSV, XLSX, XML, or JSON files and then build apps based on the data. Alternatively, you can copy and paste CSV data or load sample data.

3. On the **Load Data** page, click **Choose File**.

    ![Choose file](images/choose-file.png " ")

4. Download and select [**demo_projects.csv**](files/demo_projects.csv) file from your local system.

    ![select demo_projects file](images/select-demo-projects.png " ")

5. Review the parsed data. For **Table Name**, enter **DEMO_PROJECTS** and click **Load Data**.

    ![Select Demo_projects table](images/new-table-name.png " ")

    After clicking **Load Data**, you will see a spinner until the page finishes loading the data.

## Task 2: Create an Application

After loading the project data, you will create an application based on the newly created table. This task involves customizing the application by removing unnecessary pages generated by default. Once completed, you will have a basic application ready for further customization.

1. Verify that 70 rows are loaded into the **DEMO_PROJECTS** table in the **Load Data** dialog page. Then, click **Create Application**.

    ![Data loaded into Demo_projects](images/data-loaded.png " ")

2. From the Create an Application page, you will remove the following pages:

    - Demo Projects Search

    - Demo Projects Report

    - Calendar

    On the **Create an Application** page, click **Edit** next to the **Demo Projects Search**.

    ![Edit Demo Projects Search](images/delete-pages.png " ")

3. Click **Delete** on the **Add Faceted Search Page** and then confirm it by clicking **OK**.

    ![Click Delete](images/delete-page1.png " ")

    ![Perform delete action](images/delete-page2.png " ")

    Repeat the steps for **Demo Projects Report** and **Calendar** pages.

4. Click **Create Application**.

    ![Create application2](images/create-application2.png " ")

    When the wizard finishes creating the Application, you will be redirected to the Application's home page in the App Builder.

## Task 3: Load Application Blueprint

In this task, you will learn how to load the *Demo Projects* application using the **Load Blueprint** feature in Oracle APEX.

An **Application Blueprint** is a JSON document that represents the structure and settings of an application. You can view and edit this blueprint by opening the *Create Application Wizard*. Any changes you make to the JSON can be applied directly to update your application.

You can also load a blueprint from a previously created application. This allows you to add new pages, adjust features, or update settings before generating the application again.

This task will guide you step-by-step on how to load a blueprint to customize your application.

1. Select the **Demo Projects** application on the workspace home page.

    ![Select Demo demo projects](images/demo-projects.png " ")

2. Click **Edit Application Definition**.

    ![Edit Application Definition](images/edit-app-definition.png " ")

3. Click **Delete** to delete the application.

    ![Edit Application Definition](images/delete-demo-projects.png " ")

4. Click **Permanently Delete Now**.

    ![Delete Permanently](images/delete-app.png " ")

5. Now, to restore the application using Blueprint, click **Create** on the workspace home page.

    ![Click Create](images/blueprint-create.png " ")

6. Select **Use Create App Wizard**.

    ![Click Use create App wizard](images/blueprint-create-app-wizard.png " ")

7. At the top of the page, click **Load Blueprint**.

    ![Click Load Blueprint](images/load-blueprint.png " ")

8. Select **Load** on the **Demo Projects** row.

    ![Click Load ](images/load-blueprint-button.png " ")

9. Click **Create Application**.

    ![Click Create Application ](images/create-demo-projects.png " ")

## Task 4: Configure Progressive Web App Attributes

In this task, you will enable Progressive Web App (PWA) attributes for your application. This will allow the app to behave like an installable native application, providing an enhanced user experience with offline functionality and a mobile-friendly interface.

1. Navigate to **Shared Components** from the application home page.

    ![Select Shared Components](images/navigate-to-shared-components1.png " ")

2. Under **User Interface**, select **Progressive Web App**.

    ![Select Progressive Web App](images/navigate-to-pwa1.png " ")

3. **Toggle On** Installable and click **Apply Changes**.

    ![PWA Definition](images/navigate-to-pwa.png " ")

## Task 5: Run and Explore the New App

Finally, you will run and explore the application you created. This task helps you understand how end users will interact with the app. You will also learn how to install the app on your system, enabling quick access like a regular desktop or mobile application.

1. Navigate back to **Demo Projects** application and click **Run Application**. This will open the runtime application in a new browser tab, allowing you to see how end users will view the app.

    ![Run Application](images/run-application2.png " ")

    ![Run Application](images/run-application1.png " ")

2. Enter your user credentials and click **Sign In**.

    *Note: Use the same Username and Password you used to sign into the APEX Workspace.*

    ![Sign In](images/sign-in3.png " ")

3. Click the **Install App** icon and **Install** to install the application on your local system.

    ![Click on Install App](images/install-app2.png " ")

## Summary

You now know how to create a spreadsheet application by dragging and dropping a file or loading sample data for training purposes.

## What's Next?

The next workshop will teach you to navigate and review the page designer panes. You will know how to create a normal page, add a region, sub-region, and page items, and lock and unlock pages.
