# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**
Oracle APEX is a low-code application platform for Oracle Database. APEX Application Development, Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), and Autonomous JSON Database are fully managed services, pre-integrated and pre-configured with APEX, for rapidly building and deploying modern data-driven applications in Oracle Cloud. Business users, citizen, and application developers can create enterprise apps 20X faster with 100X less code â€” without having to learn complex web technologies with just a browser.

In this workshop, you create the starter Online Shopping Application based on existing tables. You will also create an application from a Spreadsheet.

### Recap
In the preceding workshop, you gained knowledge on installing sample tables. You acquired skills in appending new columns to pre-existing tables, filling the new columns with data, and generating lookup tables. Additionally, you were assigned the task of crafting a package. Finally, you mastered creating database objects through Quick SQL, loading data with the Data Generator, and employing the Data Workshop page for data loading.


Estimated Time: 25 minutes

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:
* Create an application using the tables and data you have installed.
* Create a Database application from a file.
* Create an application from Spreadsheet.
