    ![](./images/save-icon.png " ")
    
## Task 3: Add the Dashboard Page

A dashboard page is a great way to show important information using various charts. When you installed the Sample Dataset, it also created a number of views, which join data from various tables. These views are ideal as the basis for the dashboard charts.

1. In the Create Application wizard, click **Add Page**.

2. Click **Dashboard**.

    ![](./images/add-dashboard.png " ")

3. For Chart 1, enter the following:

    * Chart Type – select **Bar**
    * Chart Name – enter **Top 10 Products**
    * Table or View – select **PRODUCT_ORDERS**
    * Label Column – select **PRODUCT_NAME**
    * Type – select **Sum**
    * Value Column – select **TOTAL_SALES**.

    ![](./images/chart1.png " ")

4. Click Chart 2, and enter the following:

    * Chart Type – select **Pie**
    * Chart Name – enter **Top 5 Stores**
    * Table or View – select **STORE_ORDERS**
    * Label Column – select **STORE_NAME**
    * Type – select **Sum**
    * Value Column – select **TOTAL_SALES**.

    ![](./images/chart2.png " ")

5. Click Chart 3, and enter the following:

    * Chart Type – select **Pie**
    * Chart Name – enter **Order Status**
    * Table or View – select **CUSTOMER\_ORDER\_PRODUCTS**
    * Label Column – select **ORDER_STATUS**
    * Type – select **Count**
    * Value Column – select **ORDER_ID**.

    ![](./images/chart3.png " ")    

6. Click Chart 4, and enter the following:

    * Chart Type – select **Bar**
    * Chart Name – enter **Product Reviews**
    * Table or View – select **PRODUCT_REVIEWS**

    ![](./images/chart4.png " ")  

7. Click Advanced and check **Set as Administration Page**.

    Setting a page as Administration Page will make that only certain users can run the page. In this case, only users with Administration Rights will be able to run the Dashboard page, which means that this page will require authentication.
    
    ![](./images/set-admin.png " ")
    
8. Click **Add Page**.

## Task 4: Add the Products Page

1. In the Create Application wizard, click **Add Page**.
2. Click **Faceted Search**.

    ![](./images/faceted-search.png " ")

3. On the Faceted Search Page, enter the following:
    - Page Name - enter **Products**

    Expand Advanced Section and check **Set as Home Page**

    Click **Add Page**.

    ![](./images/fs-page.png " ")  

## Task 5: Delete Original Home Page

Since we designated the product faceted search page as the application's home page, we no longer need the default home page that the wizard included in the list of pages. Therefore, in this task, we will remove the original home page.

1. Navigate to the original page named "Home" and click **Edit**.

## Task 10: Finish Creating the Application

Now that you have added all the pages, it is time to generate the app and review it.

    ![](./images/create-app.png " ")

2. Once the application is created, you will find the new app on the application home page.

## Task 11: Run the Application

1. Enter your user credentials. Click **Sign In**.

2. The new application will be displayed. Explore the pages that you just created by clicking on the navigation menu.

You now know how to create an application with a number of different page types based on existing database objects. You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
