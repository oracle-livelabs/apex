# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**

Oracle APEX is a feature of Oracle Database, including the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), Autonomous JSON Database (JSON) and APEX Application Development (APEX) services. Oracle APEX is a low-code development environment with various features and tools where you can create an application fast. In the future, rather than emailing spreadsheets to gather information, you will know how to easily create an app in minutes using APEX and email the URL instead. The result will be a secure, scalable, multi-user app that provides a single source-of-truth for your data!

In this lab, you will gain an insight into the abilities of Smart Filters and learn how to add **New Filters** and edit existing Filters.

Then, you will learn how to improve the Products page by adding new facets and customizing the cards.

### Recap

In the last hands-on workshop, you learned how to add Dynamic Actions, Computations and Page Processes.

Estimated Time: 40 minutes

### Objectives

- Optimize Smart Filters by tailoring existing filters, introducing new ones, and enabling advanced input types like ranges, checkbox groups, and client-side filtering.

- Improve both **Faceted Search** and **Cards** region.

- Add **Dynamic Actions** to the page.

- Enhance Classic Reports by customizing attributes, integrating features like Download BLOB, and displaying images and dynamic links for improved data interaction.
