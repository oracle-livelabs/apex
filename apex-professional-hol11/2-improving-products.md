# Improve the product page

## Introduction

In this Lab, you learn how to improve the Products page by adding new facets and customizing the cards.

*Please note that customers can quickly identify the products already added to the shopping cart.*

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives
In this Lab, you will:
- Improve both Faceted Search and Cards region
- Add Dynamic Actions to the page

### Downloads

- Did you miss out on trying the previous labs? Don't worry! You can download the application from **[here](files/online-shopping-cart-6.sql)** and import it into your workspace. To run the app, please run the steps described in **[Get Started with Oracle APEX](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/run-workshop?p210_wid=3509)** and **[Using SQL Workshop](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/run-workshop?p210_wid=3524)** workshops.

## Task 1: Navigate to the Products Page.

In this Lab, you will be using an Online Shopping Application. Navigate to **Online Shopping Application**. In the Runtime environment, navigate to **Products**. This is the page where customers can explore the products and select what they wish to buy.
As you can see, it's hard to find the products, and it would be beneficial to see additional details related to the products.


1. From the runtime application, navigate to the **Products** page in **Page Designer**.

    Given that you run this app from the APEX App Builder, you will find the Developer Toolbar at the bottom of the screen.
    *{Note: End users who log directly into the app will not see this toolbar.}*

    In the Developer Toolbar, click **Page 19**.

    ![Navigate to page 19](./images/navigate-to-page19.png " ")

    Alternatively, you can also manually navigate back to the APEX App Builder tab in your browser by selecting the appropriate browser tab or window.   
    Once in the App Builder, click **19 - Products**.

    ![19 - Products](./images/alt-app-builder.png " ")

    You should now be in Page Designer with **Page 19: Products** loaded.


## Task 2: Reorder Facets
Unit price is not a standard search criterion, so you want to put this facet at the bottom.

1. In the Rendering tree (left pane), under Search, within Facets, click and hold **P19\_UNIT\_PRICE** and drag it down until it is under **P19\_CLOTHING\_ID**, then release the mouse.

    ![Reorder Facets](./images/reorder-facets.png " ")


## Task 3: Enhance the Faceted Search

1. In the Rendering tree (left pane), navigate to **Search**.
2. In the Property Editor (right pane), click **Attributes** and do the following:
    -   For Total Row Count Label - enter **Total Products**
    -   For Show Charts - select **No**


  ![Change faceted search](./images/change-faceted-search-attr.png " ")    

## Task 4: Enhance the Cards Region

1. In the Rendering tree (left pane), navigate to **Search Results** and in the Property Editor (right pane), do the following:
    - For SQL Query - enter the following SQL code:

                    FROM   "COLOR_LOOKUP" l1
                    WHERE  l1."COLOR_ID" = m." COLOR_ID") "COLOR_ID_L$1",
            "DEPARTMENT_ID",
            (
                    SELECT l2."DEPARTMENT"
                    FROM   "DEPARTMENT_LOOKUP" l2
                    WHERE  l2."DEPARTMENT_ID" = m." DEPARTMENT_ID") "DEPARTMENT_ID_L$2",
            "CLOTHING_ID",
            (
                    SELECT l3."CLOTHING"

## Summary
You now know how to enhance faceted search and cards region. You may now **proceed to the next Lab**.

## What's next
In the next Lab, you learn how to Create and Customize a Form and then link the form to an Interactive Report. This process involves designing a user-friendly data entry form and connecting it to a dynamic, interactive report that displays data from a database table.
