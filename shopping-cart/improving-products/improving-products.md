### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
- Improve both Faceted Search and Cards region
- Add Dynamic Actions to the page

## Task 1: Create and Reorder Facets

The **Products** page is where your customers can explore the products and select what they wish to buy.
As you can see, it's hard to find the products and it would be beneficial to see additional details related to the products.

1. From the runtime application, navigate to the **Products** page in **Page Designer**.

    Given that you run this app from the APEX App Builder, you will find the Developer Toolbar at the bottom of the screen.
    *{Note: End users who log directly into the app will not see this toolbar.}*

    In the Developer Toolbar click **Edit Page 1**.

    ![Products page in the application](./images/dev-toolbar-s.png " ")

    Alternatively, you can also navigate back to the APEX App Builder tab in your browser manually by selecting the appropriate browser tab or window.   
    Once in the App Builder click **1 - Products**.

    ![App Builder home page](./images/alt-app-builder1.png " ")

    You should now be in Page Designer with **Page 1: Products** loaded.

2. In the left pane, under **Search** region, right-click **Facets** and click **Create Facet**.

    ![App Builder home page](./images/facets1.png " ")

3. Create the following three Facets one after the other:

    | Name             |  Type   | Label | List of Values > Type | List of Values | Database Column |
    | ---------------  |  ------ |-----| ---------  | ------ | ------ |
    | P1\_DEPARTMENT\_ID | Checkbox Group | Department |Shared Component | DEPARTMENT\_LOOKUP.DEPARTMENT | DEPARTMENT\_ID |
    | P1\_COLOR\_ID | Checkbox Group | Color | Shared Component | COLOR\_LOOKUP.COLOR | COLOR\_ID |
    | P1\_CLOTHING\_ID | Checkbox Group | Clothing |Shared Component | CLOTHING\_LOOKUP.CLOTHING | CLOTHING\_ID |

    ![App Builder home page](./images/facets3.png " ")

4. Unit price is not a common search criteria, so you want to put this facet at the bottom.
    In the Rendering tree (left pane), under Search, within Facets, click and hold **P1\_COLOR\_ID** and drag it down until it is under **P1\_CLOTHING\_ID**, then release the mouse. Also, drag **P1\_UNIT\_PRICE** under **P1\_CLOTHING\_ID**.
    Reorder the facets to display as in this image.

    ![Rendering tree in the Page Designer](./images/reorder-facet-1.png " ")

## Task 2: Enhance the Faceted Search

1. In the Rendering tree (left pane), navigate to **Search**.

2. In the Property Editor (right pane), click **Attributes** and enter/select the following:
    -  Total Row Count Label: **Total Products**

    -  Show Charts: **No**
