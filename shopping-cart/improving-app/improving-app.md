### Objectives
In this lab, you will:
- Set the following pages as public pages:
    - Products
    - Shopping Cart
    - Order Information

- Disable the Navigation Menu

- Enhance the Navigation Bar

## Task 1: Set Pages to be Public
Your customers don't need to log in the app to shop the products, so let's set the following pages as public:
- Page  1: Products
- Page 16: Order Information
- Page 17: Shopping Cart
- Page 18: Add to Cart

Follow these steps for the four listed pages:

1. From the runtime application, navigate to the page.

    In the Developer Toolbar click **Edit Page 1**.

2. Within Page Designer, in the Rendering tree (left pane), navigate to  **Page 1: Products**.

    In the Property Editor (right pane), apply the following change:
    - Under Security section:
        - For Authentication - select **Page Is Public**

    ![Property Editor](./images/public-page.png " ")

3. Click **Save**.

4. Navigate to Page Finder and go to the next page.

    ![Page Finder toolbar at the top](./images/page-finder1.png " ")

## Task 2: Clean the Navigation Menu
Since the home page is the Products page and this is a public access page as some others too, it's not needed to have a navigation menu.
In this task, you will turn off displaying the navigation menu.

1. Within Page Designer, click the Shared Components icon at the top right.

    ![Page Designer with the toolbar](./images/shared-components.png " ")

   Alternatively, if you are in the App Builder, click Shared Components.

   ![App Builder home page](./images/shared-components2.png " ")

2. Under User Interface, click **User Interface Attributes**.

    ![Shared Components page](./images/interface-attributes.png " ")
3. Click **Navigation Menu**.

4. Set Display Navigation to **Off**.

    ![User Interface Attributes page](./images/nav-menu.png " ")

5. Click **Apply Changes**.

## Task 3: Enhance the Navigation Bar List
Add a new navigation menu entry to allow:
- Customers to go directly to the Shopping Cart
- Administrators to login and access to administration page

1. Click the Shared Components icon at the top right.

    ![Shared Components Page](./images/shared-components3.png " ")
2. Under Navigation and Search, click **Navigation Bar List**.

    ![Shared Components Page](./images/navigation-bar.png " ")

3. Click **Navigation Bar**.

  ![Navigation Bar List](./images/click-nav-bar.png " ")

4. Click **Create Entry** and enter the following:

    - For Sequence - enter **1**
    - For Image/Class - **&SHOPPING\_CART\_ICON.**

    ![Create Navigation entry details](./images/create-entry2.png " ")

7. Click **&APP_USER.**

    ![Navigation Bar List](./images/edit-app-user.png " ")

8. Under Authorization, for Authorization Scheme, select **Administration Rights**.

9. Click **Apply Changes**.

    ![Edit Navigation list entry](./images/authorization.png " ")

10. Click **Create Entry**  and enter the following:
    - For Sequence - enter **5**
