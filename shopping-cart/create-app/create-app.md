    ![Upload icon wizard](./images/save-icon.png " ")
    
## Task 3: Add the Dashboard Page

A dashboard page is a great way to show important information using various charts. When you installed the Sample Dataset, it also created a number of views, which join data from various tables. These views are ideal as the basis for the dashboard charts.

1. In the Create Application wizard, click **Add Page**.

2. Click **Dashboard**.

    ![Add Page wizard](./images/add-dashboard.png " ")

3. For Chart 1, enter the following:

    * Chart Type – select **Bar**
    * Chart Name – enter **Top 10 Products**
    * Table or View – select **PRODUCT_ORDERS**
    * Label Column – select **PRODUCT_NAME**
    * Type – select **Sum**
    * Value Column – select **TOTAL_SALES**.

    ![Chart 1 wizard](./images/chart1.png " ")

4. Click Chart 2, and enter the following:

    * Chart Type – select **Pie**
    * Chart Name – enter **Top 5 Stores**
    * Table or View – select **STORE_ORDERS**
    * Label Column – select **STORE_NAME**
    * Type – select **Sum**
    * Value Column – select **TOTAL_SALES**.

    ![Chart 2 wizard](./images/chart2.png " ")

5. Click Chart 3, and enter the following:

    * Chart Type – select **Pie**
    * Chart Name – enter **Order Status**
    * Table or View – select **CUSTOMER\_ORDER\_PRODUCTS**
    * Label Column – select **ORDER_STATUS**
    * Type – select **Count**
    * Value Column – select **ORDER_ID**.

    ![Chart 3 wizard](./images/chart3.png " ")    

6. Click Chart 4, and enter the following:

    * Chart Type – select **Bar**
    * Chart Name – enter **Product Reviews**
    * Table or View – select **PRODUCT_REVIEWS**

    * Type – select **Column Value**
    * Value Column – select **AVG_RATING**.

    ![Chart 4 wizard](./images/chart4.png " ")  

7. Click Advanced and check **Set as Administration Page**.

    Setting a page as Administration Page will make that only certain users can run the page. In this case, only users with Administration Rights will be able to run the Dashboard page, which means that this page will require authentication.
    
    ![Advanced section in Create Application wizard](./images/set-admin.png " ")
    
8. Click **Add Page**.

## Task 4: Add the Products Page

1. In the Create Application wizard, click **Add Page**.
2. Click **Faceted Search**.

    ![Add Page wizard](./images/faceted-search.png " ")

3. On the Faceted Search Page, enter the following:
    - Page Name - enter **Products**
    - Select **Cards**
    - Table - select **PRODUCTS**
    - Select **Grid**
    - Title Column - select **PRODUCT_NAME**
    - Body Column - select **- Select Column -** (to unselect the default column chosen)

    Expand Advanced Section and check **Set as Home Page**

    Click **Add Page**.

    ![Add Page wizard](./images/fs-page.png " ")  

## Task 5: Delete Original Home Page

Since we designated the product faceted search page as the application's home page, we no longer need the default home page that the wizard included in the list of pages. Therefore, in this task, we will remove the original home page.

1. Navigate to the original page named "Home" and click **Edit**.

    ![Create Application wizard](./images/edit-home.png " ")  
    
2. Click **Delete**.    

    ![Edit page wizard](./images/delete-page.png " ")

2. Click the arrow to the left of **Additional Pages** to see additional page types.

3. On the Create Multiple Reports Page, select the following tables:
    - CLOTHING_LOOKUP
    - COLOR_LOOKUP
    - CUSTOMERS
    - DEPARTMENT_LOOKUP

    ![Edit Page wizard](./images/admin-pages.png " ")

## Task 8: Add Manage Products Page

1. In the Create Application wizard, click **Add Page**.
2. Click **Interactive Report**.

    ![Add Page wizard](./images/ir-page.png " ")

3. On the Report Page, enter the following:
    - Page Name - enter **Manage Products**
    - Table - select **PRODUCTS**
    - Check **Include Form**

4. For Lookup Columns, enter the following:

Features are a set of optional application capabilities Oracle APEX can include for your new application. Access Control enables role-based user authorization with a single click.

1. Under **Features** section, check **Access Control**.

    ![Features section in the Create Application wizard](./images/access-control.png " ")

## Task 10: Finish Creating the Application

Now that you have added all the pages, it is time to generate the app and review it.

1. Scroll to the bottom of the page, and click **Create Application**.

    ![Create Application wizard](./images/create-app.png " ")

2. Once the application is created, you will find the new app on the application home page.
Click **Run Application**.
    
    ![Application home page](./images/run-app.png " ")

## Task 11: Run the Application

1. Enter your user credentials. Click **Sign In**.

    ![Application login page](./images/sign-in.png " ")


2. The new application will be displayed. Explore the pages that you just created by clicking on the navigation menu.

    ![New application is displayed](./images/view-app.png " ")


You now know how to create an application with a number of different page types based on existing database objects. You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
