3. Adjust the icon if needed and click **Save Icon**.

    ![Upload icon wizard](./images/save-icon.png " ")

## Task 3: Add the Dashboard Page

A dashboard page is a great way to show important information using various charts. When you installed the Sample Dataset, it also created a number of views, which join data from various tables. These views are ideal as the basis for the dashboard charts.

1. In the Create Application wizard, click **Add Page**.

    ![Add Page](./images/add-page.png " ")

2. Click **Dashboard**.

    ![Add Page wizard](./images/add-dashboard.png " ")

3. Select **Chart 1**, enter/select the following:

    - Chart Type: **Bar**

    - Chart Name: **Top 10 Products**

    - Table or View: **PRODUCT_ORDERS**

    - Label Column: **PRODUCT_NAME**

    - Type: **Sum**

    - Value Column: **TOTAL_SALES**

    ![Chart 1 wizard](./images/chart1.png " ")

4. Select **Chart 2**, enter/select the following:

    - Chart Type: **Pie**

    - Chart Name: **Top 5 Stores**

    - Table or View: **STORE_ORDERS**

    - Label Column: **STORE_NAME**

    - Type: **Sum**

    - Value Column: **TOTAL_SALES**

    ![Chart 2 wizard](./images/chart2.png " ")

5. Select **Chart 3**, enter\select the following:

    - Chart Type: **Pie**

    - Chart Name: **Order Status**

    - Table or View: **CUSTOMER\_ORDER\_PRODUCTS**

    - Label Column: **ORDER_STATUS**

    - Type: **Count**

    - Value Column: **ORDER_ID**

    ![Chart 3 wizard](./images/chart3.png " ")

    - Table or View: **PRODUCT_REVIEWS**

    - Value Column: **AVG_RATING**

    ![Chart 4 wizard](./images/chart4.png " ")

7. Navigate to **Advanced**, check **Set as Administration Page** and Click **Add Page**.

    Setting a page as Administration Page will make that only certain users can run the page. In this case, only users with Administration Rights will be able to run the Dashboard page, which means that this page will require authentication.

    ![Advanced section in Create Application wizard](./images/set-admin.png " ")

## Task 4: Add the Products Page

1. In the **Create an Application** wizard, click **Add Page**.

    ![Add Page wizard](./images/add-page-facet.png " ")

2. Click **Faceted Search**.

    ![Add Page wizard](./images/faceted-search.png " ")

4. Navigate to **Advanced**, check **Set as Home Page** and select **Add Page**.

    ![Add Page wizard](./images/fs-page1.png " ")

## Task 5: Delete Original Home Page

Since we designated the product faceted search page as the application's home page, we no longer need the default home page that the wizard included in the list of pages. Therefore, in this task, we will remove the original home page.

1. Navigate to the original page named "Home" and click **Edit**.

    ![Create Application wizard](./images/edit-home.png " ")

2. Click **Delete**.

    ![Edit page wizard](./images/delete-page.png " ")

3. Confirm the deletion by clicking **OK** on the dialog.

1. In the **Create an Application** wizard, click **Add Page**.

2. Navigate **Additional Pages** to see additional page types and select **Multiple Reports**.

    ![Add Page wizard](./images/multiple-reports.png " ")

3. On the **Add Multiple Reports** dialog, select the following tables:

    - CLOTHING_LOOKUP
    - COLOR_LOOKUP
    - CUSTOMERS
    - DEPARTMENT_LOOKUP
    - PRODUCT_REVIEWS
    - STORES

4. Click **Add Pages**.

    ![Add Page wizard](./images/multiple-reports2.png " ")

    ![Edit Page wizard](./images/edit-multiple-reports.png " ")

3. Click **Save Changes**.

    ![Edit Page wizard](./images/admin-pages.png " ")

## Task 8: Add Manage Products Page

1. In the **Create an Application** wizard, click **Add Page**.

2. Click **Interactive Report**.

    ![Add Page wizard](./images/ir-page.png " ")

3. On the **Add Report Page**, enter/select the following:

    - Page Name: **Manage Products**

    - Table: **PRODUCTS**

    - Check **Include Form**

4. Navigate to **Advanced**, check **Set as Administration Page** and select **Add Page**.

    ![Add Page wizard](./images/ir-page2.png " ")

## Task 9: Set Features

Features are a set of optional application capabilities Oracle APEX can include for your new application. Access Control enables role-based user authorization with a single click.

1. Under **Features** section, check **Access Control**.

## Task 11: Run the Application

1. Enter your user credentials. Click **Sign In**.

    ![Application login page](./images/sign-in.png " ")

2. The new application will be displayed. Explore the pages that you just created by clicking on the navigation menu.

    ![New application is displayed](./images/view-app.png " ")

## Summary

You now know how to create an application with a number of different page types based on existing database objects. You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
