# Build an Upload & Ingest AI Agent with Low-Code APEX

## Introduction

This lab walks the user through the process of building an APEX app and completing the first half of the development - the Upload & Ingest functionality. Using the OCI REST Data Source of Object Storage, the user can see what is in the Bucket that their knowledge base will be trained on. By executing a process to trigger the Ingest, the AI Agent will be trained on the newest data loaded. 

Estimated time - 45 minutes

### Objectives

* Provision a 23ai ADB and APEX App
* Update the Credentials to Connect to OCI Resources
* Create the Application
* Create REST Data Sources
* Create Object Storage List Page
* Test Upload Functionality
* (Optional) Double check that the Ingestion job has fired

### Prerequisites

* An OCI cloud account
* Subscription to US-Central Chicago Region
* Previous Lab has been completed

## Task 1: Provision a 23ai ADB and APEX App

1. Navitage to the OCI home console and expand the side-menu bar.

	![home menu bar](./images/home-menu.png "")

2. Select the **Oracle Database** and click the **Autonomous Database** Option.

	![Navigate to Autonmous Database](./images/nav-adb.png "")

3. Ensure you are in the correct compartment and select **Create Autonomous Database**. The region in which you provision the ADB doesn't matter as much as the previous GenAI services Lab as the ADB will use the service route to access the model.

10. Edit the Process by right clicking the process and select **Add Child Process**.

	![add child process button](./images/upload-child.png)

11. Name the child process **Upload to Object Storage** and select **PL/SQL** and paste the following in the box:

	```
	<copy>
	declare
	l_request_url	varchar2(32767);
	l_content_length	number;
	l_response	clob;
	upload_failed_exception	exception;
	l_request_object	blob;
	l_request_filename	varchar2(500);
	begin
	select blob_content,filename into l_request_object,l_request_filename from apex_application_temp_files where name = :P1_FILE;
	l_request_url := ' https://objectstorage.us-chicago-1.oraclecloud.com/n/<namespace>/b/RAG/o/' || utl_url.escape(l_request_filename);
	l_response := apex_web_service.make_rest_request(
	p_url => l_request_url,
	p_http_method => 'PUT',
	p_body_blob => l_request_object,
	p_credential_static_id => 'api_key'
	);
	END; 
	</copy>
	```

* **Note:** Be sure to edit the variable **l\_request\_url** to include the correct namespace for you tenancy. This can be obtained by navigating to the Tenancy page on the OCI console.

	![name the child process and add pl/sql](./images/plsql-process.png)

12. Repeat the last step by right-clicking **Process** and select **add a child process**. Name it the following: **Ingest** and paste the following PL/SQL:

	```
	<copy>
	declare
	 c_agent_endpoint_id constant varchar2(1024) :=
	  'ocid1.genaiagentendpoint.oc1.us-chicago-1.xxxxxxxxxxxxxx';
	 l_response clob;
	begin
	 apex_web_service.set_request_headers(
	  p_name_01 => 'Content-Type'
	  , p_value_01 => 'application/json'
	 );
	l_response := apex_web_service.make_rest_request(
	  p_http_method => 'POST'
	  , p_url =>
		'https://agent.generativeai.us-chicago-1.oci.oraclecloud.com'
		|| '/20240531/dataIngestionJobs'
	  , p_credential_static_id => 'api_key'
	  , p_body => json_object(
		key 'compartmentId' value 'ocid1.compartment.oc1..xxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
		, key 'dataSourceId' value 'ocid1.genaiagentdatasource.oc1.us-chicago-1.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
		, key 'displayName' value 'APEX_INGEST'
	  )
	 );
	end;
	</copy>
	```

	![name the child process and add pl/sql](./images/ingest-plsql-process.png)

* **Note:** Be sure to edit the following fields: **compartmentId** and **dataSourceId** to match the correct values. Update **c\_agent\_endpoint\_id** from the text copied in Lab 1, Task 4, Step 7. dataSourceId can be obtained by navigating to the AI Agents page on the OCI console. Using the hamburger menu, select AI & Analytics -> AI Services -> Generative AI Agents - select **Agents** and copy the OCID on the page.

5. Verify that the file is updated in the classic report on page 1 by navigating back to the console

## (Optional) Task 7: Double check that the Ingestion job has fired
1. Navigate to the OCI Cloud Console

2. Click on the Hamburger Menu button at the top right and select **Analytics & AI**, then **GenAI Agents**.
3. Click **Knowledge Base** at the bottom of the page.

4. Click **Data Source** and Check for the Name **“APEX_INGEST”** and confirm that it is there, and check lifecycle State **Accepted/Processing/Succeeded**
