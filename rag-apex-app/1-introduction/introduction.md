# Introduction

## About this Workshop
The scope of this workshop is to create a Generative AI RAG application using Oracle APEX with Generative AI Agents in Oracle Autonomous Database. This workshop will use Oracle Object Storage as the knowledge base. 

Here is a demo of what to expect for the RAG app:

### What is Generative AI?

Generative AI enables users to quickly generate new content based on a variety of inputs. Inputs and outputs to these models can include text, images, sounds, animation, 3D models, and other types of data.

### What is Natural Language?

Natural language processing is the ability of a computer application to understand human language as it is spoken and written. It is a component of artificial intelligence (AI). We will leverage Natural Language Processing for our RAG Chatbot to understand user queries and provide relevant responses.

### What is Retrieval Augmented Generation?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances AI responses by retrieving relevant external data before generating an answer. This improves accuracy, reduces errors, and keeps information up to date. RAG works with Oracle Generative AI Agents to provide responses that are grounded in real data.

Estimated time - 1.5 hr

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:

* Set up a Knowledge Base for GenAI agents
* Build an Upload and Ingest for AI Agent using Low-Code APEX
* Build a RAG Chatbot using Low-Code APEX

### Prerequisites

* Your tenancy **must be subscribed to the US Midwest (Chicago)** region.
* Basic database and SQL knowledge.
* Familiarity with Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) is helpful.
* Familiarity with the role of REST services.

You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
