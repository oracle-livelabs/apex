# Introduction

## About this Workshop
Ready to supercharge your applications with artificial intelligence? In this hands-on Oracle LiveLab, you’ll dive into the world of GenAI agents using the power of low-code Oracle APEX. Discover how to set up a dynamic Knowledge Base, seamlessly upload and ingest data for your AI agent, and craft an intelligent RAG chatbot — all without writing complex code. Whether you’re new to AI or looking to expand your toolkit, this workshop will guide you step by step to build smarter, more responsive applications with Oracle’s cutting-edge technology.

 Here is a demo of what to expect for the RAG app:

### What is Generative AI?

Generative AI enables users to quickly generate new content based on a variety of inputs. Inputs and outputs to these models can include text, images, sounds, animation, 3D models, and other types of data.

### What is Natural Language?

Natural language processing is the ability of a computer application to understand human language as it is spoken and written. It is a component of artificial intelligence (AI). We will leverage Natural Language Processing for our RAG Chatbot to understand user queries and provide relevant responses.

### What is Retrieval Augmented Generation?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances AI responses by retrieving relevant external data before generating an answer. This improves accuracy, reduces errors, and keeps information up to date. RAG works with Oracle Generative AI Agents to provide responses that are grounded in real data.

Estimated time - 1.5 hr

### Objectives
