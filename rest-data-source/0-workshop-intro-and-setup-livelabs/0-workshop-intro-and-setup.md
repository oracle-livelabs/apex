# Introduction

## Workshop Overview
This workshop REST enables database objects, and then uses those REST endpoints as the basis for REST Data Sources within an application. Application components are then defined against these REST Data Sources, instead of being defined on local database objects.

Estimated Time: 45 minutes

### Objectives

* Obtain a free development environment
* REST enabling tables and views
* Define REST Data Sources against REST endpoints
* Build an application utilizing REST Data Sources

*Note: This lab assumes you are using Oracle APEX 20.2.*
