 To learn more about the Page Designer UI Elements, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/apex/24.2/htmdb/understanding-page-designer-ui-elements.html).

### **Runtime Developer Toolbar**
When you run an application from App Builder and view a page, the Runtime Developer toolbar displays at the bottom of any editable page. Use the Runtime Developer toolbar to quickly edit the current application or currently running page, or view session state.
