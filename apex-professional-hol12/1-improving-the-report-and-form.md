  ![View Product Details](./images/refresh-manage-products1.png " ")

## Task 3: Enhance the Form

1.  Navigate to the **Page 21** in the **App Builder**. Then Click on **P21\_PRODUCT\_NAME** in the Rendering Tree. Now, change the Identification Type to **Text Field** in the Property Editor.

    ![Navigate to Page 21](images/navigate-to-page21.png " ")

2. Items can readily be moved using drag-and-drop within Layout. If required you can also drag new components like regions, items, and buttons into the Layout pane from the Gallery, located directly below it.

  In Page Designer, with **Page 21** loaded, within Layout (middle pane), click **P21\_UNIT\_PRICE** and continue to hold the mouse down. Drag the item up and to the right, until it is directly after **P21\_PRODUCT\_NAME**, and a dark yellow box is displayed. Release the mouse to drop the item in the new location.

  In Page Designer, within Layout (or the Rendering tree in the left pane), select **P21\_IMAGE\_CHARSET**. In the Property Editor (right pane), **Under Layout > Start New Row**.

  ![Enhance form2](images/enhance-form2.png " ")

4. You now need to Focus on **First item on Page**.  In **Page Rendering**(Left Pane), Select **Page 21: Product Details**. Then, In the **Property Editor**, Scroll down to Navigation and for **Cursor Focus**, select **First item on page**. Then, click **Save**.

  ![Enhance form3](images/enhance-form3.png " ")
