# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**

Oracle APEX is a feature of Oracle Database, including the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), Autonomous JSON Database (JSON) and APEX Application Development (APEX) services. Oracle APEX is a low-code development environment with various features and tools where you can create an application fast. In the future, rather than emailing spreadsheets to gather information, you will know how to easily create an app in minutes using APEX and email the URL instead. The result will be a secure, scalable, multi-user app that provides a single source-of-truth for your data!

In this lab, you will learn how to create and customize a **Form**, and then you will link the form to an **Classic Report**.

### Recap

In the last hands-on workshop, you customized the Smart Filters page in the Demo Projects application. Also, you enhanced both the Faceted Search and Cards region and incorporated Dynamic Actions to the page.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

- Create a basic form for a database table.

- Link the form to a Classic Report for seamless navigation.

- Customize the form layout and components.

- Improve user experience by adding relevant enhancements to the form.
