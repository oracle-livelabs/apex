# Create website based on template

## Introduction

In this lab we will create site based on site template provided as part of lab file.

  >**Note**:Oracle Content Management let you create unlimited website but Starter edition is limited to 1 site per instance

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Background

As a site developer, you define the framework that site creators use to build sites, such as:
* [standard templates](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/content-cloud/creating-experiences/understand-templates.html#GUID-0BA49046-671B-4DE0-8D64-ADBFECB2EC76), used as a framework for a site, based on a theme, with sample pages and content, custom components, and other resources you need to start building a site
* [themes](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/content-cloud/creating-experiences/understand-themes.html), used to define the overall look and feel of a site, consisting of logos, style sheets, configuration files and background code that defines site navigation
* [custom components](https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/paas/content-cloud/creating-experiences/manage-custom-components-and-layouts1.html#GUID-15CB1AE6-E45C-4BD7-AE4E-41F94AFA550F), used to add specific types of content to site pages, enabling you to develop compound elements that can be embedded within a site page, using any page technology of your choice
