# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**

Oracle APEX is a feature of Oracle Database, including the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), Autonomous JSON Database (JSON), and APEX Application Development (APEX) services. Oracle APEX is a low-code development environment with various features and tools where you can create an application fast. In the future, rather than emailing spreadsheets to gather information, you will know how to easily create an app in minutes using APEX and email the URL instead. The result will be a secure, scalable, multi-user app that provides a single source-of-truth for your data!

In this hands-on lab, you will enhance your Oracle APEX applications by creating and customizing new pages such as Calendars, Charts, Tree Pages, and Maps. These pages will add dynamic functionality to your applications, improving data visualization, interactivity, and usability. You will gain practical experience by working on the Demo Projects and Online Shopping applications, exploring key Oracle APEX features such as drag-and-drop functionality, hierarchical data representation, and interactive map integration. By the end of these labs, you will have a comprehensive understanding of designing and customizing essential application components to create robust, user-friendly applications.

### Recap

In the last hands-on lab, you learned to incorporate multi-level authentication into the online shopping application.

Estimated Time: 20 minutes

### Objectives

- Create and customize a Calendar Page for tracking events and tasks.

- Build a Form Page and link it to other pages for seamless task creation and editing.

- Enable drag-and-drop functionality within the Calendar.

- Design and configure a Tree Page for hierarchical data visualization.

- Create and customize a Map Page to display geographical data dynamically.

- Integrate a custom background for Maps using Web Map Service (WMS).

- Configure pages for public access and add them to the navigation menu for enhanced usability.
