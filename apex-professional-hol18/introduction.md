# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**
Oracle APEX is a feature of Oracle Database, including the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), Autonomous JSON Database (JSON), and APEX Application Development (APEX) services. Oracle APEX is a low-code development environment with various features and tools where you can create an application fast. In the future, rather than emailing spreadsheets to gather information, you will know how to easily create an app in minutes using APEX and email the URL instead. The result will be a secure, scalable, multi-user app that provides a single source-of-truth for your data!

In this lab, you will add Calendars, Charts, Tree pages, Maps and Map Backgrounds to Demo Projects and Online Shopping applications.

### Recap
In the last hands-on lab, you learned to incorporate social sign-in (Google) into the online shopping application.

*Note: This workshop assumes you are using Oracle APEX 23.2.*

Estimated Time: 40 minutes

### Objectives
* Create and customize Calendars
* Create and customize the Tree Page.
