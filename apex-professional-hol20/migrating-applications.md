# Migrate Application Development Between Environments

## Introduction

In this lab, You will create Installation scripts and Data Packages to export Database objects along with Data. Then you will export the **DEMO PROJECTS** Application along with supporting objects and import it into another workspace.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Create Installation Scripts
- Create Data Packages
- Export application with supporting Objects.

### Downloads

- Did you miss out on trying the previous labs? Donâ€™t worry! You can download the application from **[here](files/demo-projects-5.sql)** and import it into your workspace. To run the app, please run the steps described in **[Get Started with Oracle APEX](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/run-workshop?p210_wid=3509)** and **[Using SQL Workshop](https://livelabs.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/run-workshop?p210_wid=3524)** workshops.

## Task 1: Create Installation Scripts, Data packages, and Export Applications.

1. On the Workspace home page, click the App Builder icon.

    - For **Name**, select **data.sql** (Script Name should be Unique)

    - For **Tables**, ensure **DEMO\_PROJECTS** and **EBA\_DEMO\_IR\_EMP** are listed on the right side, and if not, select and shuttle these two tables over there.

    ![Define Security Attributes](images/create-data-packages.png " ")

12. For **Create Script**, accept the defaults and click **Finish**.

    ![Create Script](images/create-data-packages1.png " ")

13. The Scripts are now Created. Navigate back to the application and Select **Export/Import**.

16. You will now notice that the application is downloaded as **fNNN.sql**

    ![File downloaded](images/exported-app.png " ")

## Task 2: Import Application into the Target Workspace and Verify Database Objects.

In this Lab, You will login into a new workspace or the Workspace you created in previous labs and import the application along with Supporting objects.

> **Note:**_In this task, Please use different environments for creating the target and the main workspace_

1. Log in to the Target **Workspace**.

    ![Login to the Target Workspace](images/login-towksp1.png " ")

2. Click **App Builder** and then select **Import**.

    ![Navigate to App Builder](images/select-app-builder.png " ")

    ![Select Import](images/select-import.png " ")

3. Under **Import**, click **Drag and Drop**.

    ![Select Drag and Drop](images/select-drag-and-drop.png " ")

4. Choose the file we exported in the previous lab from your **Local System** and then click **Next**.

    ![Select File from computer](images/select-file.png " ")

    ![Click Next](images/click-next.png " ")

5. Under **Install**, Set **Build Status** to **Run and Build Application**. Leave the remaining settings to default and Click **Install Application**.

    ![Click Install Application](images/install-app1.png " ")

6. In the **Application Installed Wizard**, Click **Install Supporting Objects**.

    ![Click Next](images/install-so1.png " ")

7. You will now see that **Your application's supporting objects have been installed**. Click **Edit Application** to review the **Database Objects**.

    ![Application installed , Click Edit Application](images/install-app3.png " ")

8. Click on the Arrow mark next to **SQL Workshop** and then click **Object Browser**.

    ![Navigate to Object Browser](images/object-browser1.png " ")

9. Select **DEMO\_PROJECTS** table and then click **Data**. Verify the Data in the table **DEMO\_PROJECTS**.

    ![Navigate to DEMP_PROJECTS to view data](images/object-browser2.png " ")

## Summary

You now know how to create Installation scripts and Data Packages to export Database objects along with Data. You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
