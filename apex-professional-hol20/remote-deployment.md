# Migrate Application Development Between Environments

## Introduction

In this lab, You will be using Remote Deployment to deploy your Application from Development to UAT. The ORDS feature, **REST Enabled SQL** is not available for **apex.oracle.com** users. Therefore, you will not be able to perform this lab in the hosted instance apex.oracle.com. You should be using **APEX Service** or **APEX on Autonomous Database** options for this lab.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Export application with supporting Objects.
- Use Remote Deployment to deploy your Application.

### Downloads

- Did you miss out on trying the previous labs? Don’t worry! You can download the application from **[here](files/demo-projects-6.sql)** and import it into your workspace. To run the app, please run the steps described in **[Get Started with Oracle APEX](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/run-workshop?p210_wid=3509)** and **[Using SQL Workshop](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/run-workshop?p210_wid=3524)** workshops.

## Task 1: Import Sample application.

The ORDS feature, **REST Enabled SQL** is not available for **apex.oracle.com** users. Therefore, you will not be able to perform this lab in the hosted instance apex.oracle.com. You should be using **APEX Service** or **APEX on Autonomous Database** options for this lab.

In this Lab, You will install a **Sample Application** in a new workspace you created either on **APEX Service** or **APEX on Autonomous Database**. Please follow the steps in **Get Started with Oracle APEX** workshop to provision an instance or to create workspace on **APEX Service** or **APEX on Autonomous Database**.

1. Log in to the new Workspace you created.

    ![Login to new workspace you created](images/login-to-dev.png " ")

2. Navigate to **Gallery** by clicking **Gallery** button at the top.

    ![Navigate to Gallery](images/navigate-to-gallery.png " ")

3. Once you Navigate to Gallery, Click **Sample Apps**.

4. Now that you are in **Sample Apps**, search for apps by typing "**Reporting**" into the "Search Apps" search box and navigate to **Sample Reporting** and click the **Install** Button.

    ![Install Sample Reporting](images/install-sample-app.png " ")

4. Note that you application status is currently under **Installing** phase.

    ![Install Application](images/install-app.png " ")

5. You can now see that the application is installed. Run the application by selecting **Run Application**.

    ![Run Application](images/click-run-application.png " ")

6. Log in to the **Sample Reporting** application as an End User. Enter your **Username** and **Password** (Same as your Workspace credentials) and click **Sign In**.

    ![Sign In Sample App](images/run-application1.png " ")

7. You now see the Sample Reporting application home page. In your Runtime environment under **Developer Toolbar**, click **Home** to return to the home page of the APEX development environment.

    ![Home Screen of Sample App](images/navigate-to-sample-reports.png " ")

8. Click **App Builder**.

   ![Navigate App Builder](images/navigate-to-app-builder.png " ")

9. Toggle between the **View Icons** and the **View Reports** buttons. You see that applications are displayed along with their icons and report format.
   ![View Icons](images/display-as-icons1.png " ")

## Task 2: Configure the Target System.

In this Lab, You will enable the **Target System** to **ORDS**, and then you will copy the URL and paste it into your notepad.

**Note**: You need to provision a new **APEX Service** or **APEX on Autonomous Database** and create a new workspace in order to perform this lab.

1. Log in to your **Target System**.

  ![Login into Target system](images/sign-out1.png " ")

2. Navigate to **SQL Workshop > RESTful Services**.

  ![Navigate to RESTful Services](images/enable-ords1.png " ")

3. Click **Register Schema with ORDS**.

  ![Click Register Schema with ORDS](images/enable-ords2.png " ")

4. Review the **ORDS Schema Attributes** and click **Save Schema Attributes**. Now, you see a message that the schema has been successfully registered.​

  ![Click Save Schema Attributes](images/enable-ords3.png " ")

5. Navigate to **SQL Workshop > Restful Services**. Expand **RESTful Data Services > Modules > oracle.example.hr > empinfo/ GET**. Copy the **Full URL** and paste it into your **Clipboard** or **Notepad**.

  ![Copy Full URL](images/copy-url.png " ")

6. Click **Sign Out**.

  ![Click Sign Out](images/sign-out2.png " ")


## Task 3: Remote Deployment.

Your application is now ready for deployment. Perform the following steps:

1. Log in to your development environment (WS_APEXDEV in this example)

  ![Login into your Development environment](images/login-to-dev.png " ")

2. Navigate to your application home page. select **App Builder** and then click **Sample Reporting**.

  ![Navigate to Sample Reporting](images/select-sample-reporting.png " ")

3. Click **Export / Import**.

  ![Click Export/Import](images/select-export.png " ")  

4. Select **Remote Deployment** and click **Next**.

  ![Select Remote Deployment](images/select-rd.png " ")    

5. Choose an existing **REST Enabled SQL Service** or create a new one. In this example, click the **Add Deployment Server** ( **+** ) icon next to the Deployment Server select list.

  ![Add Deployment Server](images/perform-rd1.png " ")

6. Enter the base URL for the **REST Enabled SQL Service** defined for your deployment server (APEX_HANDSON_TARGET in this example). The schema in your deployment server has already been enabled for use with ORDS RESTful Data Services in prerequisites.  
For **Endpoint URL**, paste the base URL copied from the deployment instance in the previous step(**Task 4**). The base URL should include the ORDS context root and schema URL prefix. For example, https://host:8096/ords/apexstage. Then, click Next.

  ![Paste the file URL which you Copied](images/perform-rd2.png " ")

7. In the **Create REST Enabled SQL Service - Authentication** wizard, perform the following steps.
    - For Credential Name, Enter **Credential for APEX_TARGET**.
    - For Username, provide the workspace associated **Schema Name**. In this example, enter **wksp_apexhandsontarget**.
    - For Password and Verify Password, enter your Schema Password.
   Click **Create**.

  ![Select Basic Authentication and click next](images/perform-rd3.png " ")

8. Now you see a message that REST Enabled SQL Service has been created.

  ![Select Basic Authentication and click next](images/connection-successful.png " ")


9. From the Deployment Server select list, choose the one that you just created.

  ![Define Remote Deployment attributes and click next](images/select-deployment-server.png " ")

10. Click **Next**.

  ![Define Remote Deployment attributes and click next](images/click-next.png " ")

11. The Remote Deployment Options page appears.

    - Under **Deploy Application**: Set **Build Status Override** to **Run and Build Application**.
    - Under **Export Preferences**: For **Export Supporting Object Definitions**, select **Yes and Install on Import Automatically**.
    - Under **Deployment Overrides**: In this example, even though the application does not yet exist on the target system, turn the **Overwrite Existing Application option** **On** so that you can preserve the application ID, and enable this application for future overwrites.

    After making the above selections, click **Deploy**.

    ![Enable Overwrite Existing Application](images/perform-rd5.png " ")

10. You see the Remote Deployment Successful message. Your application has been successfully deployed to the remote server.

    ![Application Deployed Successfully](images/perform-rd6.png " ")

11. Log in to your remote APEX instance. Make sure that the application is available and with the same application id as in the source system.

    ![Login into your remote APEX Instance](images/perform-rd7.png " ")

## Summary

You now know how to deploy your Application from Development to Target.
