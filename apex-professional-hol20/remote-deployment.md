# Migrate Application Development Between Environments

## Introduction

In this lab, you will be using Remote Deployment to deploy your application from Development to UAT. The ORDS feature, **REST Enabled SQL** is not available for **apex.oracle.com** users. Therefore, you will not be able to perform this lab in the hosted instance apex.oracle.com. You should be using **APEX Service** or **APEX on Autonomous Database** options for this lab.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Export application with Supporting Objects.

- Use Remote Deployment to deploy your Application.

## Task 1: Import Sample application

The ORDS feature, **REST Enabled SQL** is not available for **apex.oracle.com** users. Therefore, you will not be able to perform this lab in the hosted instance apex.oracle.com. You should be using **APEX Service** or **APEX on Autonomous Database** options for this lab.

In this Lab, you will install a **Sample Application** in a new workspace you created either on **APEX Service** or **APEX on Autonomous Database**. Please follow the steps in **Get Started with Oracle APEX** workshop to provision an instance or to create workspace on **APEX Service** or **APEX on Autonomous Database**.

1. Log in to the new workspace you created.

    ![Login to new workspace you created](images/login-to-dev.png " ")

2. Navigate to **Gallery**. Under **Sample Apps**, search for apps by typing "**Reporting**" into the "Search Apps" search box and navigate to **Sample Reporting**.

    ![Navigate to Gallery](images/gallery-page2.png " ")

3. Click **Install**.

    ![Install Sample Reporting](images/install-sample-app.png " ")

4. You can now see that the application is installed. Run the application by selecting **Run Application**.

    ![Run Application](images/click-run-application.png " ")

5. Log in to the **Sample Reporting** application as an End User. Enter your **Username** and **Password** (Same as your Workspace credentials) and click **Sign In**.

    ![Sign In Sample App](images/log-in-to-the-app.png " ")

6. You now see the Sample Reporting application home page. In your Runtime environment, under **Developer Toolbar**, click **Home** to return to the home page of the APEX development environment.

    ![Home Screen of Sample App](images/navigate-to-sample-reports.png " ")

7. Click **App Builder**.

    ![Navigate App Builder](images/navigate-to-app-builder1.png " ")

8. Toggle between the **View Icons** and the **View Reports** buttons. You see that applications are displayed along with their icons and report format.

    ![View Icons](images/display-as-icons1.png " ")

    ![View Icons](images/display-as-report1.png " ")

## Task 2: Configure the Target System

In this Lab, you will enable the **Target System** to **ORDS**, and then you will copy the URL and paste it into your notepad.

**Note**: You need to provision a new **APEX Service** or **APEX on Autonomous Database** and create a new workspace in order to perform this lab.

1. Log in to your **Target System**.

   ![Login into Target system](images/sign-out1.png " ")

2. Navigate to **SQL Workshop > RESTful Services**.

   ![Navigate to RESTful Services](images/enable-ords1.png " ")

3. Click **Register Schema with ORDS**.

   ![Click Register Schema with ORDS](images/enable-ords2.png " ")

4. Review the **ORDS Schema Attributes** and click **Save Schema Attributes**. Now, you see a message that the schema has been successfully registered.â€‹

   ![Click Save Schema Attributes](images/enable-ords3.png " ")

5. Navigate to **SQL Workshop > Restful Services**. Expand **RESTful Data Services > Modules > oracle.example.hr > empinfo/ GET**. Copy the **Full URL** and paste it into your **Clipboard** or **Notepad**.

   ![Copy Full URL](images/copy-url.png " ")

6. Click **Sign Out**.

   ![Click Sign Out](images/sign-out2.png " ")

## Task 3: Remote Deployment

Your application is now ready for deployment. Perform the following steps:

1. Log in to your development environment (WS_APEXDEV in this example)

   ![Login into your Development environment](images/login-to-dev.png " ")

2. Navigate to your application home page. select **App Builder** and then click **Sample Reporting**.

   ![Navigate to Sample Reporting](images/select-sample-reporting.png " ")

3. Click **Export / Import**.

   ![Click Export/Import](images/select-export.png " ")

4. Select **Remote Deployment** and click **Next**.

   ![Select Remote Deployment](images/select-rd.png " ")

5. Choose an existing **REST Enabled SQL Service** or create a new one. In this example, click the **Add Deployment Server** ( **+** ) icon next to the Deployment Server select list.

   ![Add Deployment Server](images/perform-rd1.png " ")

6. Enter the base URL for the **REST Enabled SQL Service** defined for your deployment server (APEX\_HANDSON\_TARGET in this example). The schema in your deployment server has already been enabled for use with ORDS RESTful Data Services in prerequisites.

    For **Endpoint URL**, paste the base URL copied from the deployment instance in the previous step(**Task 2**). The base URL should include the ORDS context root and schema URL prefix. For example, https://host:8096/ords/apexstage. Then, click **Next**.

    ![Paste the file URL which you Copied](images/perform-rd2.png " ")

7. In the **Create REST Enabled SQL Service - Authentication** wizard, perform the following steps.

    - Credential Name: **Credential for APEX\_TARGET**.

    - Username: provide the workspace associated **Schema Name**. In this example, enter **wksp_apexhandsontarget**.

    - Password and Verify Password: enter your Schema Password.

    Click **Create**.

    ![Select Basic Authentication and click next](images/perform-rd3.png " ")

8. Now you see a message that REST Enabled SQL Service has been created.

    ![Select Basic Authentication and click next](images/connection-successful.png " ")

9. From the Deployment Server select list, choose the one that you just created.

    ![Define Remote Deployment attributes and click next](images/select-deployment-server.png " ")

10. Click **Next**.

    ![Define Remote Deployment attributes and click next](images/click-next.png " ")

11. The Remote Deployment Options page appears.

    - Deploy Application > Build Status Override: **Run and Build Application**.

    - Export Preferences > Export Supporting Object Definitions: **Yes and Install on Import Automatically**.

    - **Deployment Overrides**: In this example, even though the application does not yet exist on the target system, turn the **Overwrite Existing Application option** **On** so that you can preserve the application ID, and enable this application for future overwrites.

    After making the above selections, click **Deploy**.

    ![Enable Overwrite Existing Application](images/perform-rd5.png " ")

12. You see the Remote Deployment Successful message. Your application has been successfully deployed to the remote server.

    ![Application Deployed Successfully](images/perform-rd6.png " ")

13. Log in to your remote APEX instance. Make sure that the application is available and with the same application id as in the source system.

    ![Login into your remote APEX Instance](images/perform-rd7.png " ")

## Summary

You now know how to deploy your application from Development to Target.
