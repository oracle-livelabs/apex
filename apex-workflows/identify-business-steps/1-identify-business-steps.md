# Identify Business steps

## Introduction

In this lab, you learn to implement an efficient system to schedule and manage doctor consultations by designing an APEX Application called **Doctor Appointments Made Easy!**, that leverages the Workflow component to schedule and manage doctor consultations efficiently. To achieve this, we need to follow a structured approach:

- Break down the business logic into manageable, executable steps.
- Identify the sequences and conditions that govern the execution of these steps.
- Identify the key participants in the organization that are involved in this business process.

> **Note:** _In APEX Workflow terminology, we refer to an executable step as an **Activity** and a sequence/condition as a **Connection**._


### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Identify Business steps required to create 'Doctor Appointments Made Easy!' Application.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes


### Prerequisites
1. Access to Oracle APEX.


## Breaking down the Business Logic

We begin by dissecting the medical appointment business process into distinct steps and identifying the actors or participants associated with each step. Here's an overview:

### Steps in the Medical Appointment Business Process

| Step No. | Step Description                                             | Step Type | Actor                  |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------|------------------------|
| 1       | Schedule a doctor's appointment.                               | Manual    | Patient                |
| 2       | Login to the application, fill in patient details, and submit an appointment request on behalf of the patient. | Manual    | Hospital Management Representative/Staff |
| 3       | Check doctor's availability for the requested appointment date/time. | Automatic | Workflow              |
| 4       | If the doctor is busy, send a 'No-Appointment' email to the patient and close the appointment request. | Automatic | Workflow              |
| 5       | If the doctor is available, raise an 'Approval Task' for the doctor to confirm the appointment request. | Automatic | Workflow              |
| 6       | Log in to the application to access the appointment request. | Manual    | Doctor                 |
| 7       | Approve the appointment request. | Manual    | Doctor                 |
| 8       | Reject the appointment request. | Manual    | Doctor                 |
| 9       | If the doctor rejects, send a 'No-Appointment' email to the patient and close the appointment request. | Automatic | Workflow              |
| 10      | If the doctor approves, enter appointment details in the system with the status 'Confirmed'. | Automatic | Workflow |
| 11      | Check if the patient had a previous appointment with the same doctor in the last seven days. | Automatic | Workflow |
| 12      | If the patient had a previous appointment, mark this as a follow-up visit, don't charge fees, and raise an invoice with zero payment request for the patient to confirm. | Automatic | Workflow |
| 13      | If it's a new visit, raise an invoice with fees and payment request for the patient to confirm. | Automatic | Workflow |
| 14      | In both cases, send an email notifying the patient of the appointment confirmation and the invoice request. | Automatic | Workflow |
| 15      | Log in to the application to confirm the invoice. | Manual    | Patient                |
| 16      | If the patient doesn't confirm the invoice within a specific period, send a 'No-Appointment' email and close the appointment request. | Automatic | Workflow |
| 17      | If the patient confirms the invoice, update the appointment status to 'PAID' in the system of records | Automatic. | Workflow |
| 18      | Wait until the appointment is completed. | Automatic | Workflow |
| 19      | Raise a feedback request to the patient. | Automatic | Workflow |
| 20      | Log in to the application and provide feedback. | Manual    | Patient                |
| 21      | If the patient doesn't complete the feedback request within a specified period, close the appointment request. | Automatic | Workflow |
| 22      | If the patient provides feedback, send a 'Thank You' email to the patient and then close the appointment request. | Automatic | Workflow |

This comprehensive breakdown illustrates the significance of workflow in managing complex business processes, making the system efficient and responsive.
