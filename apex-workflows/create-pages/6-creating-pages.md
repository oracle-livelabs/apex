## Task 6: Create the View Appointment Workflows Page

Finally, we need the page that the Hospital Management Staff will use to monitor the appointment workflow.

We use the Workflow Console and Details pages with **Initiated By Me** report context, which allows a logged-in user to view all Workflows Initiated by him or her.

> **Tech Tips:** _The Workflow Console allows workspace users to view and manage their workflow instances, including My Workflows for workflow owners, Admin Workflows for workflow administrators, and Initiated by Me for workflow initiators. When configuring the Workflow Console, you have different Report Contexts to choose from. You will learn about these in subsequent blogs._

1. To create the Workflow Console and Details pages, On the Application home page, select Create Page.

2. Under Components, select **Workflow Console**.

    ![configure feedbacks attr](./images/create-workflow-console.png " ")

3. In the Create Workflow Console wizard,
    - Under Page Definition,
        - Set Name as **Monitor Appointment Workflows**
        - Select **Report Context** to **Initiated By Me**.
        - For the Workflow Details page, set the Form Page name as **Appointment Workflow Details**
    - Under **Navigation**
        - For **Breadcrumb**, Set it to **Yes**.
        - For **Breadcrumb Parent Entry** select **Home (Page 1)**
        - Set **Parent Region Menu Entry** as **Home**.

    ![configure feedbacks attr](./images/config-workflow-console.png " ")
4. Click **Create Page**.

5. Run the application and navigate through different pages to demonstrate the workflow, tasks, and feedback functionalities.

## Summary
You have successfully created a comprehensive Oracle APEX application for managing doctor appointments with workflows, task lists, and feedback features.

### What's Next

In the next lab, you will run and understand the behaviour of the **Doctor Appointments Made Easy!** application through hands-on activities. You will also perform various tasks to understand the workflow and automation implemented in the application.
