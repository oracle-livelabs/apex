# Build a 'Doctor Appointments Made Easy' App using Oracle APEX

## Introduction

APEX Workflows is a relatively new addition to the larger APEX ecosystem, offering fundamental workflow capabilities for APEX Developers.

What are Workflows?

In this context, Workflows entail the automation of business processes, whether in their entirety or in part. It involves the seamless transfer of documents, information, or tasks from one participant to another for actions following a predefined set of procedural rules, including sequence flow and transition conditions (source).

With the first release of APEX Workflows, you can harness the following capabilities:

- **Visual Workflow Designer**: Craft and author workflow models with ease
- **Workflow Console**: Monitor and administer workflows efficiently
- **Workflow Runtime (Engine)**: Execute workflows seamlessly

Estimated Time: 2 hours 35 minutes

## Simplify Business Process Management with Workflows

The primary objective of Workflows is to simplify and automate the management of intricate business logic by breaking it down into simple, repeatable steps. In this workshop, we showcase the utility of APEX Workflows through a real-world use case prevalent in the healthcare industry.

In diagnostic clinics and hospital outpatient departments (OPDs), scheduling and managing consultations and appointments becomes a challenging task. Throughout this workshop, you gain insights into building a smart, efficient, low-code APEX application that efficiently handles these crucial healthcare processes using the Workflow component.

Stay tuned for a journey into the world of streamlined business process management with APEX Workflows!
