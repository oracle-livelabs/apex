# Build a Doctor Appointments Made Easy App using Oracle APEX

## Introduction

APEX Workflow is a fresh addition to the larger APEX ecosystem, offering fundamental workflow capabilities for APEX Developers.

What is Workflow?

In this context, Workflow entails the automation of business processes, whether in their entirety or in part. It involves the seamless transfer of documents, information, or tasks from one participant to another for actions following a predefined set of procedural rules, including sequence flow and transition conditions (source).

In the First release of APEX Workflow, you can harness the following capabilities:

- Visual Workflow Designer: Craft and author workflow models with ease.
- Workflow Console: Monitor and administer workflows efficiently.
- Workflow Runtime (Engine): Execute workflows seamlessly.

Estimated Time: 155 minutes

## Simplify Business Process Management with Workflow

The primary objective of Workflow is to simplify and automate the management of intricate business logic by breaking it down into simple, repeatable steps. In this blog series, we showcase the utility of APEX Workflow through a real-world use case prevalent in the healthcare industry.

Scheduling and managing consultations and appointments represent core operations for diagnostic clinics and hospital outpatient departments (OPDs). Throughout this series, you gain insights into constructing a smart, efficient, and low-code APEX application that adeptly handles these crucial healthcare processes using the Workflow component.
