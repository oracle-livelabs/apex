# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**
Oracle APEX is a feature of Oracle Database, including the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), Autonomous JSON Database (JSON) and APEX Application Development (APEX) services. Oracle APEX is a low-code development environment with various features and tools, where you can create an application fast. In the future, rather than emailing spreadsheets around to gather information, you will know how to easily create an app in minutes using APEX and email the URL instead. The result will be a secure, scalable, multi-user app that provides a single source-of-truth for your data!


Application security is very important for majority of the applications. You must ensure that users enter valid credentials, generally username and password (Authentication), and the logged in user has appropriate rights within the application (Authorization).

*Note: This workshop assumes you are using Oracle APEX 22.2.*

### Objectives

* Implement Social Sign-In in your application.
* Create and Use Authorization Schemes.
