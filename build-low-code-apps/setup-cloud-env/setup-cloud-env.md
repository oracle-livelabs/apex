# Setup Cloud Environment

## Introduction

You will take on the persona of an Operations Engineer. You will initiate the Oracle cloud environment that will be used to create and deploy your microservices applications. This environment will be contained within a cloud Compartment, and communication within the Compartment will be via a Virtual Cloud Network (VCN). The Compartment and VCN will isolate and secure the overall environment. You will deploy two Oracle Cloud Services for this environment. An Oracle Cloud Developer Image will be used to develop and deploy your microservices code. The microservices will access data within an Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) Cloud Service.

To deploy these services, you will use Terraform, a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. It is an important tool for anyone looking to standardize IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) within their organization.

Estimated time: 20 minutes

### Objectives
- Log into OCI Tenancy.
- Setup Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) components.  
- Create an Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP) Database.
- Create an OKE Cluster.
- Create Visual Builder Studio (Developer Cloud Service) instance.
- Create Visual Builder Cloud Service (VBCS) instance.

***We recommend that you create a notes page to write down all of the credentials you will need.***

### Prerequisites
- An Oracle Cloud Account - Please view this workshop's LiveLabs landing page to see which environments are supported

*Note: If you have a **Free Trial** account, when your Free Trial expires your account will be converted to an **Always Free** account.

  ![](images/cloudshell-2.png " ")

4. Execute below commands in cloudshell. We are going generate a public and private key pair.

    ```
    <copy>
    mkdir ~/.oci
    openssl genrsa -out ~/.oci/oci.api.key.pem 2048
    chmod go-rwx ~/.oci/oci.api.key.pem
    openssl rsa -pubout -in ~/.oci/oci.api.key.pem -out ~/.oci/oci.api.key.public.pem
    cat ~/.oci/oci.api.key.public.pem
    </copy>
    ```

  Below are steps for reference

  ![](images/cloudshell-4.png " ")

  ![](images/cloudshell-3.png " ")

5. Make sure to **copy the generated public key** and paste in a notepad, we will need it for the next step.

  ![](images/cloudshell-5.png " ")

6. We will also need to copy the generated **private key** and paste it into a notepad, we will use it later on. Enter in the following command:

    ```
    <copy>
    cat ~/.oci/oci.api.key.pem
    </copy>
    ```
7. Make sure to include ----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY---- and ----END RSA PRIVATE KEY----
