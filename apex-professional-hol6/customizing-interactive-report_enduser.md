## Task 1: Customize an Interactive report as an End User

 In this lab, you customize and use an interactive report as an end user.

1. To start with, run the **Sample Reporting** application. Click **App Builder**.

    ![App Builder](images/navigate-to-app-builder.png " ")

2. Navigate to **Sample Reporting** and then click **Run Application**.

    ![Run Application](images/navigate-to-sr.png " ")

    ![Run Application](images/run-application11.png " ")

3. In the **navigation menu** or in the **Cards Region**, click **Interactive Report**.

    ![Cards Region](images/click-ir.png " ")

4. Suppose you want to avoid displaying the report's **Start Date** and **End Date** columns. Also, you want the **Status** column to show just after the **Assigned To** column. To do so, perform the following steps:  

    a. Click **Actions** and select **Columns**.

    ![select Columns](images/select-columns.png " ")

    b. The Select Columns dialog appears. The columns on the right are displayed, and those on the left are hidden. Select **Start Date** and **End Date** in **Display in Report group**, and move the selected columns into the **Do Not Display** list by clicking the left arrow **<**.

    ![Display in Report group](images/select-columns1.png " ")

    c. You can reorder the displayed columns using the arrows on the far right.
    Select **Status** in the Display in Report group and click the **Down arrow** once. Then, click **Apply**.

    ![reorder the displayed columns](images/select-columns3.png " ")

    d. The interactive report is displayed with the changes made in the above steps.

    ![interactive report](images/run-ir1.png " ")

5. Next, let's say you want to filter the report results. First, you want to filter the report to display rows which meet the criteria **Cost <= 2000**. Within these filtered results, you create another filter to show rows with **Project is Bug Tracker**. Perform the following steps:  

    a. Click **Actions** and select **Filter**.

    ![filtered results](images/select-filter1.png " ")

    b. In the Filter dialog, enter/select the following:

    - Column: **Cost**
    - Operator: **<=**
    - Expression: **2000**

    Click **Apply**.

    ![Filter Type](images/create-filter1.png " ")

   c. Next, add the second filter to the **Project** column. Click the **Actions > Filter**.

    ![Filter](images/select-filter2.png " ")

   d. In the Filter Dialog, select the following:

    - Column: **Project**
    - Operator: **=**
    - Expression: **Bug Tracker**

    Click **Apply**.

    ![Filter](images/create-filter2.png " ")

    ![Filter](images/run-ir2.png " ")

   e. Notice that two filters are applied. Fewer rows are displayed because only the rows that meet the filter criteria are displayed. You can remove each filter by clicking the **Remove Filter** icon next to the filter you want to remove.  
   Click the **Remove Filter** icon next to both filters.

    ![Remove Filter](images/delete-filter1.png " ")

6. Now, imagine you want to sort the report on the **Cost** column. To do so, perform the following:

    a. Select **Actions** > **Data** > **Sort**.

    ![Sort](images/select-sort.png " ")

    b. Remove the existing sort columns under **Column** for rows 2 and 3. Restore the value to the default **- Select Column -**.

    ![Sort](images/create-sort1.png " ")

    c. Select the following in Row 1:

    - Column: **Cost**
    - Direction: **Descending**

     Click **Apply**.

    ![Sort](images/create-sort2.png " ")

    d. The report is now sorted in the **Descending** order of **Cost**.

7. Create an aggregation against the **Available Budget** column. You want to display the sum of the **Available Budget**. Perform the following:

    a. Select **Actions** > **Data** > **Aggregate**.

    ![Aggregate](images/select-aggregate.png " ")

    b. In the **Aggregate** dialog, select the following:

    - Function: **Sum**
    - Column: **Available Budget**.

    Click **Apply** to add the aggregation at the end of the last Column of the report.

    ![Aggregate](images/create-aggregate1.png " ")

    c. The aggregate function is applied to the Column. Notice that the sum of **Available Budget** is displayed at the end of the report under the Column. Navigate to the last page to view the sum.

    ![Aggregate](images/run-ir3.png " ")

8. In the report, you want to include **Cost** calculated with tax. The computation you want to make is **Cost * 1.05**. You create a computed column in the interactive report.

    a. Select **Actions** > **Data** > **Compute**.

    ![Compute](images/select-compute1.png " ")

    b. The Compute dialog appears. Enter/select the following:
      - Column Label: **Cost with Tax**.  
      - Computation Expression:
            - Under Columns alias, click **Cost**
            - Under Keypad, click *1.05

      Click **Apply**.

    ![Compute](images/create-compute1.png " ")

    c. The new computed Column **Cost with Tax** now appears in the report.

    ![Compute](images/run-ir5.png " ")

9. Create a Control Break on the **Project** column.

    a. Select **Actions** > **Format** > **Control Break**.

    ![Control Break](images/create-control-break.png " ")

    b. In the Control Break dialog, in row number 1, for Column select **Project**, and click **Apply**.

    ![Control Break](images/create-cb1.png " ")  

    c. The control break is now applied. Notice that the aggregation you created in a previous step appears at the end of each control break.

    ![Control Break](images/run-ir6.png " ")  

10. Let's say you want to highlight those rows with **Cost** value less than or equal to **500**. You add the highlighting to rows while continuing with the control break you created in the previous step.

    a. Select **Actions** > **Format** > **Highlight**.

    ![Highlight](images/select-highlight.png " ")

    b. In the Highlight dialog, enter/select the following:

       - Name: **Cost less than or equals 500**

       - Background Color: **#d0f1cc**

       - Text Color: **#0000000**

       - Column: **Cost**

       - Operator: **<=**

       - Expression: **500**

      Click **Apply**.

    ![Highlight](images/create-highlight1.png " ")  

   c. Notice that the rows that meet the condition are highlighted in **Green**.

    b. In the Chart dialog, select/enter the following:  
      - Chart Type: **Bar**  
      - Label: **Project**  
      - Value: **Cost**  
      - Function: **Average**  

      Click **Apply**.

    ![Chart](images/create-chart1.png " ")

    c. The chart is created. Toggle between the **View Chart** and **View Report**.

    ![Chart](images/run-ir9.png " ")

13. Create a Group By report to display each **Project** with the **Total Budget**.  
    a. Click **View Report**.  
       Select **Actions** > **Group By**.
