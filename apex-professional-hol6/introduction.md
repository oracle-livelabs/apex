# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**
Oracle APEX is a feature of Oracle Database, including the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), Autonomous JSON Database (JSON) and APEX Application Development (APEX) services. Oracle APEX is a low-code development environment with various features and tools where you can create an application fast. In the future, rather than emailing spreadsheets to gather information, you will know how to easily create an app in minutes using APEX and email the URL instead. The result will be a secure, scalable, multi-user app that provides a single source-of-truth for your data!

### Recap
In the last hands-on lab, you learned to add interactive grid, Smart filters, and Content row to an application. Also, you learned to create application items and application processes. Moreover, you created a normal and modal page long with cards region and added an action.

In this hands-on lab, you will Manage and Customise the Interactive report in the **Sample Reports** application both as a **Developer** and as an **End-user**.

Estimated Time: 35 minutes


### Objectives

* Customise your Interactive Report page in **Sample Reports** Application as a **Developer**.
* Customise your Interactive Report page in **Sample Reports** Application as an **End-user**.

*Note: This workshop assumes you are using Oracle APEX 23.2.*
