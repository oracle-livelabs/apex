5. When the end users click an edit icon for a specific row, they should be directed to a page showing the row's column values. The interactive report currently has a link column to a Form Page. Modify your interactive report to have a link to a single-row view.

    In the Property Editor, navigate to **Attributes > Search Bar**. Enter/select the following:

    - Rows Per Page Selector: Toggle the button to **ON**
    - Maximum Rows Per Page: **10**
