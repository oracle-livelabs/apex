# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**

Oracle APEX is a feature of Oracle Database, including the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), Autonomous JSON Database (JSON) and APEX Application Development (APEX) services. Oracle APEX is a low-code development environment with various features and tools, where you can create an application fast. In the future, rather than emailing spreadsheets around to gather information, you will know how to easily create an app in minutes using APEX and email the URL instead. The result will be a secure, scalable, multi-user app that provides a single source-of-truth for your data!

This lab focuses on extending the functionality of your application by integrating advanced features such as email notifications, feedback collection, and automated workflows. Through practical exercises, you will enhance the Online Shopping Application, creating a seamless and user-friendly experience for customers. The lab will provide you with hands-on experience in configuring processes, sending automated emails, and designing feedback mechanisms, ultimately improving application efficiency and usability.

Estimated Time: 15 Mins

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Configure and send automated emails from your application.

- Design a feedback collection page for user input.
