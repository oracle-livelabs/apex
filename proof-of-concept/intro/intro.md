# Smart Project Management App with AI-Assisted Development in Oracle APEX

## Introduction

In this lab, you will build a dynamic application using Oracle APEX AI Assistant. You will start by installing a sample project management dataset, then create an initial application with the help of an AI Assistant, demonstrating how AI can accelerate development. Next, you will customize your application the lowcode way, making quick adjustments using pre-built components. You will also enhance your application by writing SQL queries with APEX Assistant, simplifying complex query construction. Finally, you will implement an AI chat assistant using Dynamic Actions and Chat Widget, creating a responsive chat interface for real-time user engagement. By the end of this lab, you'll have practical knowledge in using AI with APEX to efficiently build and customize powerful applications.

Estimated Time: 55 minutes
