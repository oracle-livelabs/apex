# Oracle APEX Hands-On Lab

## Building a Proof-of-Concept for Oracle Autonomous Cloud Services

## Overview
This lab starts with a napkin design of data structures we would
like to use for a proof-of-concept. Using Quick SQL you will quickly
define the data structures and utilize various table and column
directives to better define the tables and also create some
dummy data. You will then be creating an application based on
the new tables. Lastly, you will be updating some of the generated
components to improve the initial app.

## Lab Objectives

* Obtain a free development environment
* Define new tables and views
* Create an application on the new data structures
* Refine the application

*{Note: This lab assumes you are using Oracle APEX 20.2.}*
