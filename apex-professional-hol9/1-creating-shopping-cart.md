### Downloads

- Did you miss out trying the previous labs? Donâ€™t worry! You can download the application from **[here](files/online-shopping-cart-4.sql)** and import it into your workspace. To run the app, please run the steps described in in **[Get Started with Oracle APEX](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/run-workshop?p210_wid=3509)** and **[Using SQL Workshop](https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/dbpm/livelabs/run-workshop?p210_wid=3524)** workshops.


## Task 1: Create Validations on the Page

1. Navigate to the **App Builder**.

    ![Click App Builder](./images/click-app-builder.png " ")

2. Then Click on **Online Shopping Application**.

    ![Select Online Shopping Cart App](./images/click-app-builder1.png " ")

2. Now you select **Shopping Cart** under **Page Icons**.

    ![Navigate to Shopping Cart Page](./images/navigate-to-shopping-cart-page.png " ")

3. In the Rendering tree (left pane), click **Processing** tab.

4. Over **Validating**, right-click **Create Validation**.

     ![Create a Validation](./images/create-validation1.png " ")  

5. Create three validations for the following items: Name, Email, and Store

    ![Customise Validation](./images/create-validation2.png " ")

    | Name |  Type (under Validation) | Item |
    | --- |  --- | --- |
    | Validate Name | Item is NOT NULL | P16\_CUSTOMER\_FULLNAME |
    | Validate Email | Item is NOT NULL | P16\_CUSTOMER\_EMAIL |
    | Validate Store | Item is NOT NULL | P16_STORE |

    Under Error:

    | Error Message | Display Location | Associated Item |
    | --- |  --- | --- |
    | Please enter your name | Inline with Field and in Notification | P16\_CUSTOMER\_FULLNAME |
    | Please enter your email address | Inline with Field and in Notification | P16\_CUSTOMER\_EMAIL |
    | Please select a store | Inline with Field and in Notification | P16_STORE |

     ![Customise Validation](./images/create-validation3.png " ")

     As these validations only apply when user proceeds to checkout, let's create that condition.
     Under Server-side Condition, set the following:

    | Name  | When Button Pressed |

    | Validate Name  | Proceed |

## Summary

In this hands-on lab, You learned to create data validations for page items, ensuring data accuracy. You also implemented a dedicated page process to streamline order creation. Additionally, the lab covered clearing the shopping cart and enabling a seamless transition to the checkout process, enhancing the overall user experience.  You may now **proceed to the next lab**.

## Whats Next:

In the next lab, you explore the use of Dynamic Actions to efficiently manage the shopping cart, allowing for real-time updates. Additionally, you learn how to review product details and enabling users to add, edit, or remove items from their cart with the help of Page Process.
