    | Name |  Type (under Validation) | Item |
    | --- |  --- | --- |
    | Validate Name | Item is NOT NULL | P16\_CUSTOMER\_FULLNAME |
    | Validate Email | Item is NOT NULL | P16\_CUSTOMER\_EMAIL |
    | Validate Store | Item is NOT NULL | P16_STORE |

    Under Error:

    | Error Message | Display Location | Associated Item |
    | --- |  --- | --- |
    | Please enter your name | Inline with Field and in Notification | P16\_CUSTOMER\_FULLNAME |
    | Please enter your email address | Inline with Field and in Notification | P16\_CUSTOMER\_EMAIL |
    | Please select a store | Inline with Field and in Notification | P16_STORE |

     As these validations only apply when user proceeds to checkout, let's create that condition.
     Under Server-side Condition, set the following:

    | Name  | When Button Pressed |
    | ---   |  --- |
    | Validate Name  | Proceed |
    | Validate Email | Proceed |
