# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**
Oracle APEX is a feature of Oracle Database, including the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), Autonomous JSON Database (JSON) and APEX Application Development (APEX) services. Oracle APEX is a low-code development environment with various features and tools where you can create an application fast. In the future, rather than emailing spreadsheets to gather information, you will know how to easily create an app in minutes using APEX and email the URL instead. The result will be a secure, scalable, multi-user app that provides a single source-of-truth for your data!

### Recap
In the last hands-on lab, you learned how to add page buttons and items to a page.

In this workshop, you create Validations, Computations, and Processes in order to implement features such as validating email, name, and son on. You also implement processes to clear the cart and create an order in the Online Shopping App.

- Create validations on the Page Items.
- Create a Page process to create the Order
- Clear the shopping cart
- Proceed to checkout

Estimated Time: 15 minutes
