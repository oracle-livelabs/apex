# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**

Oracle APEX is a feature of Oracle Database, including the Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) and Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), Autonomous JSON Database (JSON) and APEX Application Development (APEX) services. Oracle APEX is a low-code development environment with various features and tools where you can create an application fast. In the future, rather than emailing spreadsheets to gather information, you will know how to easily create an app in minutes using APEX and email the URL instead. The result will be a secure, scalable, multi-user app that provides a single source-of-truth for your data!

### Recap

In the last hands-on lab, you learned how to add page buttons and items to a page.

Estimated Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Create validations to ensure required fields are filled.

- Implement processes to create orders and manage the shopping cart.

- Add branching logic to transition between pages efficiently.

- Clear the shopping cart and proceed to checkout seamlessly.
