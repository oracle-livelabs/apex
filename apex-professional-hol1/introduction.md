# Introduction

## **What is APEX?**

Oracle APEX is a low-code application platform for Oracle Database. APEX Application Development, Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW), Autonomous Transaction Processing (ATP), and Autonomous JSON Database are fully managed services, pre-integrated and pre-configured with APEX, for rapidly building and deploying modern data-driven applications in Oracle Cloud. Business users, citizen, and application developers can create enterprise apps 20X faster with 100X less code â€” without having to learn complex web technologies with just a browser.

In this workshop, you learn to obtain an APEX workspace. Once you have an APEX workspace provisioned, you explore the components like App Builder, SQL Workshop and Gallery in APEX. Later, you also learn to install a Sample Reporting App from the Gallery and run the app.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes
