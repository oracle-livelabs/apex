## Introduction

In this lab, you log into your Oracle APEX workspace and explore key features like App Builder, SQL Workshop, and the Gallery. You'll learn to navigate the environment and install sample applications.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Navigate through the significant components of Oracle APEX.

- Install and run a packaged application.

## Task 1: Explore the significant Components of APEX

In this task, you go through the initial steps of logging into your Oracle APEX workspace and exploring the various components available within the development environment. You will begin by accessing the APEX workspace, which will introduce you to key features such as the App Builder, SQL Workshop, and the Gallery.

1. To log in to your Oracle APEX workspace, perform the following steps:

    - Open your browser and enter the **URL** to sign in to the APEX development environment.

    - The login page appears. Enter your **Workspace Name, Username, and Password** and click **Sign In**.

## Task 2: Install Sample Application

In this task, you install and explore a **Sample Reporting** application in Oracle APEX. You navigate to the Gallery, install the app, and log in as an end user to familiarize yourself with its interface. Additionally, you learn how to toggle between different views in the App Builder, helping you understand how applications are displayed and managed in APEX.

1. Navigate to **Gallery**, select **Sample Apps**.

   ![Click Sample Apps](images/gallery-page3.png " ")

2. Now, navigate to **Sample Reporting**, and click **Install**. You can also search for apps by entering **Reporting** in the **Search Apps** field.

   ![Install Sample Reporting](images/install-sample-app.png " ")

3. You see that the application is installed. Click **Run Application**.

   ![Run Application](images/click-run-application.png " ")

4. Log in to the **Sample Reporting** application as an End User. Enter your username and password (the same as your Workspace credentials) and click **Sign In**.

   ![Sign In Sample App](images/log-in-to-the-app.png " ")

5. You now see the **Sample Reporting** application's home page. In your runtime environment, a Developer Toolbar appears at the bottom. Click **Home** to return to the home page of the APEX application development environment.

   ![Home Screen of Sample App](images/navigate-to-sample-reports.png " ")

6. Click **App Builder**.

   ![Navigate App Builder](images/navigate-to-app-builder1.png " ")

7. Toggle between the **View Icons** and the **View Reports** buttons. You see that applications are correspondingly displayed along with their icons and in the report format.

   ![View Icons](images/display-as-icons1.png " ")

   ![View Reports](images/display-as-report1.png " ")

## Summary

You have now learned how to navigate the significant components of Oracle APEX and install and run a packaged application. You are ready to proceed to the next lab.

## What's Next?

In the next hands-on lab, you will gain practical experience in utilizing SQL Workshop. You will explore tasks such as installing a Sample Dataset, extending existing table­s by adding new columns, populating new columns, creating lookup tables, developing Package­s, and utilizing various utilities such as Quick SQL, Data Workshop, and Data Generator.
