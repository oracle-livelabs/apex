2. In the Property Editor, select the following:
    - Under Navigation Menu:
        - Override User Interface Level: Toggle the button to **ON**
        - List: **Do not show the Navigation Menu List**

## Task 2: Remove the Breadcrumb Region

Since our app is a Single Page Application, we do not need a breadcrumb bar at the top of the page. Let's proceed with deleting the default breadcrumb.

1. In the Rendering Tree, navigate to **Components** > **Breadcrumb Bar**. Right click on **APEX Social Media**, and select **Delete**.

    Observe how the tree reflects after the breadcrumb was deleted.

2. Click **Save and Run** to see how they have affected our app so far.

    **Once you are signed in, your app should look like this:**

    **Note:** We will repeat this process of iterating over the app development: Make changes, Save and Run and review the effects of our changes.

    Switch back to your browser tab with **Page Designer**.

## [OPTIONAL] Alternate Time Saver

In this task, you will learn how to download and import a starter app. If you follow this lab, you can skip Lab 1, Lab 2, Lab 3, and Lab 4. Once you complete this task, proceed to Lab 5.

1. Download the [Starter App](https://c4u04.objectstorage.us-ashburn-1.oci.customer-oci.com/p/EcTjWk2IuZPZeNnD_fYMcgUhdNDIDA6rt9gaFj_WZMiL7VvxPBNMY60837hu5hga/n/c4u04/b/livelabsfiles/o/data-management-library-files/APEX_Social_Media_HOL_LAB1-4_completed.zip) for Social Media workshop. This app has all the functionality performed in Lab 1,2,3 and 4.

2. To import an application, from your app builder, click **Import**.
