# Build the Cards Region

## Introduction

In this lab, you learn to create the CARDS region that can query the data
the way we need it, and configure the region attributes to suit our
goals.

Estimated Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Create the Cards region to display the posts
- Configure the attributes of the Cards region to maych our design

### Prerequisites

- Completion of workshop through Lab 5

## Task 1: Create a Cards Region

1. Navigate to the Rendering Tree and right-click on **Body**, and
choose **Create Region**.   

    ![Create region option](images/create-region.png)

2. Update the following attributes in the Property Editor:

    - Under Identification:
         - For Title, enter **Timeline**
         - For Type, select **Cards**

    ![Property Editor](images/title-type.png)

    - Under Source, for Type select **SQL Query**.

3.  Clear the **SQL Query** that was automatically put into the SQL
    Query box. The attributes should look like the following:


4.  Copy and paste the following **SQL** statement into that box and
    *tab out* of it

    ```
    <copy>
        select
        p.id,
        p.created_by AS user_name,
        p.post_comment AS comment_text,
        p.file_blob,
        p.file_mime,
        
        apex_util.get_since(p.created) post_date,

        (
            select count(*) from SM_REACTIONS smr 
            where smr.post_id=p.id
        ) as REACTIONS,

        (
            select 'user-has-liked' from SM_REACTIONS smr 
            where smr.post_id=p.id and created_by=:APP_USER
        ) USER_REACTION_CSS

        from SM_POSTS p 

        order by p.created desc
    </copy>
    ```

    And this is the final configuration for the **Region** tab:

    ![SQL expression in editor](images/sql-code.png)

5. Scroll down on the list of Region attributes to the **Appearance**
section:

    - In the Appearance > CSS Classes box, put **t-Chat**

    - Under **Advanced** section, for **Static ID** specify **timeline**.

    ![Property editor](images/appearance.png)

    We're not quite done with this region yet. We have to configure
which columns from the query results will be used on which parts of the
CARDS themselves.

## Task 2: Configure the Attributes of the Cards Region

1. In the Property Editor, select the **Attributes** tab, and make
the following changes:

    - Card > Primary Key Column 1: **ID**

    - Title > Column: **USER_NAME**

    - Subtitle > Column: **POST_DATE**

    ![Attributes in Property Editor](images/attributes-1.png)

    - Body > Column: **COMMENT_TEXT**

    - Icon and Badge > Icon Source: **Initials**

    - Icon Column: **USER_NAME**

    ![Attributes in Property Editor](images/attributes-2.png)

    And finally (for this Region), scroll down to the Media section, and set
these attributes:

    - Source: **BLOB column**

    - BLOB Column: **FILE_BLOB**

    - Position: **First**

    - Appearance: **Widescreen**

    - Sizing: **Cover**

    - CSS Classes: enter **selectDisable**

    - Copy and paste **&COMMENT_TEXT.** (including the period!)
    into the **Image Description** box

    - BLOB Attributes > Mime Type Column: **FILE_MIME**

    These attributes should look like this:

    ![Attributes in Property Editor](images/attributes-3.png)

2. And this completes the region. Click **Save and Run**.

    If you made a post earlier you should now see your image and your
comment text:

    ![Running app](images/run-app.png)

You may now **proceed to the next lab**
