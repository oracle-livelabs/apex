## Task 1: Create a Cards Region

1. In the Rendering Tree, right click **Body**, and select **Create Region**.

2. In the Property Editor, enter/select the following

    - Under Identification:

         - Name: **Timeline**

         - Type: **Cards**

    - Under Source:

        - Type: **SQL Query**

        - SQL Query: Copy and Paste the below code:

          ```
           <copy>
            select
            p.id,
            p.created_by AS user_name,
            p.post_comment AS comment_text,
            p.file_blob,
            p.file_mime,

            apex_util.get_since(p.created) post_date,

            (
                select count(*) from SM_REACTIONS smr
                where smr.post_id=p.id
            ) as REACTIONS,

            (
                select 'user-has-liked' from SM_REACTIONS smr
                where smr.post_id=p.id and created_by=:APP_USER
            ) USER_REACTION_CSS

            from SM_POSTS p

            order by p.created desc
           </copy>
          ```

        ![Property Editor](images/title-type1.png)

    - Appearance > CSS Classes box: **t-Chat**

    - Advanced > Static ID: **timeline**

        ![Property editor](images/appearance1.png)

    Next, we need to configure which columns from the query results will be used in different parts of the CARDS region.

## Task 2: Configure the Attributes of the Cards Region

1. In the Property Editor under the Timeline region, enter/select the following in the **Attributes** tab:

    - Card > Primary Key Column 1: **ID**

    - Title > Column: **USER_NAME**

    - Subtitle > Column: **POST_DATE**

    ![Attributes in Property Editor](images/attributes-11.png)

    - Body > Column: **COMMENT_TEXT**

    - Under Icon and Badge:

        - Icon Source: **Initials**

        - Icon Column: **USER_NAME**

    ![Attributes in Property Editor](images/attributes-21.png)

    And finally (for this Region), scroll down to the Media section, and enter/set the following attributes:

    - Under Media:

        - Source: **BLOB column**

        - BLOB Column: **FILE_BLOB**

        - Position: **First**

        - Appearance: **Widescreen**

        - Sizing: **Cover**

        - CSS Classes: **selectDisable**

        - Image Description: **&COMMENT_TEXT.** (including the period!)

    - BLOB Attributes > Mime Type Column: **FILE_MIME**

    ![Attributes in Property Editor](images/attributes-31.png)

2. Now, the region is completely configured. Click **Save and Run**.

     If you made a post earlier, you should now see your image and your comment text!
