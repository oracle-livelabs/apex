# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to create a Social Media Application where you can POST pictures, LIKE your friends' pictures, and DELETE your own pictures when needed. You can download the app to your mobile device, just like other social media apps. This workshop will provide you with great exposure to what a developer can achieve with Oracle APEX using low-code and relatively simple approaches!

When users log into the app, they can upload pictures from their local device and add comments. Users can also scroll through their feed to see what their friends have posted, LIKE their pictures, and track the number of LIKES on each post.

While the initial version of the app is simple and meant to help you get started, you can easily add more features, such as push notifications, the ability to comment on friends' pictures, and more.

Estimated Time: 1 hour 5 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walkthrough of the workshop.
