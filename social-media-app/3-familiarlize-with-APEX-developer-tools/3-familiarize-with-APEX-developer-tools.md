In this lab, you acquaint yourself with the developer tools where the APEX developers spend most of their time. You explore the APEX Developer Toolbar and the Page Designer.

Estimated Time: 5 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:
- Familiarize with the APEX Developer Toolbar
- Acquaint yourself with the Page Designer

### Prerequisites

- Completion of workshop through Lab 2

**NOTE: You can skip to [LAB 4](?lab=4-customize-app-homepage) if you are already familiar with the APEX developer tools**

## Task 1: The APEX Developer Toolbar

1. Switch back to the tab where the app is running, and notice the APEX Developer toolbar at the bottom.

    **Note**: The application end users will not see this bar. The developer tool bar is only visible to you because you are already logged into the APEX builder in another tab. The toolbar consists of quick links to features of APEX that we will continue to use for our development.

2. Click on the **Page 1**. This navigates back to the APEX Page Designer where you can begin making your changes to the page.

## Task 2: Get acquainted with APEX Page Designer

Welcome to APEX Page Designer! This is the APEX interface by which the majority of all the APEX developer magic happens!

The APEX Page Designer is organized into 3 vertical column sections, each of which can have one or more tabs within. The thin bars between each column area can be dragged to adjust their width, or the middle button can be clicked to collapse and expand the left or right sections.

1. The left side (#1 in the image below) defaults to the **Rendering Tree**, but notice that there are a few other tabs within: **Dynamic Actions**, **Processing** and **Page Shared Components**. We will learn more about these later.

This first section is a tree-view of the components that are on the page and may contain nested feature-nodes with more parts within each component. The nodes can be expanded or collapsed which will be useful as this tree content grows. Most list entries here can be dragged and dropped within the tree, and/or can be right-clicked to view a context menu with available developer options.

2. The middle section is itself divided into two sections:

    ![The layout and gallery pane is displayed](images/pd-middle.png)

The top section is the page **Layout** tab, it also has other tabs within: **Page Search** and **Help**.

**Take a moment to click on each tab to see how they look.**

The bottom section has 3 tabs: **Regions, Items** and **Buttons**. The objects within this section can be dragged and dropped into the **Layout** section depending on where you want them placed.

3. The third section on the right is called the Property Editor and displays the declarative features of the selected page component. The title of the first tab within will be the name of the component that you have selected, be it of type **Page** or **Region** and so forth. In addition, depending on what is selected, another tab titled **Attributes** might be available with more component specific declarative options. In this case, the top-most tree entry, **Page 1:Timeline** is selected,
and the Property Editor displays the **Page** related declarative features:

 Further, you will want to be aware that each tab within their respective sections might have scroll bars shown so that you can navigate down or across longer sections of options.

 **Before we continue, take a moment to practice adjusting the size of your sections, but keep them all expanded.**

  If you are confused, you can easily reset the layout back to the default with the wrench button at the top right of Page Designer:

  You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
