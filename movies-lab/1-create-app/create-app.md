# Create the Application

## Introduction

You will get started by creating a skeleton application and you will add to it in each lab until you have built a full application that allows you to create and manage a personal list of movies you have watched or want to watch.

You will also need to sign up for an account on The Movie Database and obtain an API Key. A TMDB API Key is required for this tutorial, as authentication is needed to get data from The Movie Database API.

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

## Task 2: Run the App

    ![Movies Watchlist app home with Run Application button highlighted](images/run-app.png " ")

2. On the sign in page that opens in a new tab in your browser, enter your username and password that you used to sign in to your workspace.

3. Click **Sign In**.

    ![Movies Watchlist runtime application sign-in page](images/app-sign-in.png " ")

## Task 3: Update the Theme of the App

1. In the tab that your app is running in, there will be a grey toolbar at the bottom of the page. This is your development toolbar that allows you to edit regions in your application user interface (UI) directly in the tab it's running in.  
*Note: If you do not see the grey developer toolbar, mouse over the bottom of your browser window to make it display. End users who log directly into the app will not see this toolbar.*

2. In the dev toolbar, click on **Customize** and then click **Theme Roller**.

    ![Close-up of developer toolbar in runtime application with the Customize menu open](images/dev-toolbar.png " ")

3. Within the Theme Roller, you can modify many different aspects of the application UI. You will use it right now to update the color scheme.

4. Under the **Theme** section, click on the Select Theme select box and choose **Vita - Dark**.

4. Click on **Global Colors** to expand the section.

    * Copy the HEX color code: **C74634**

    * Click on the color swatch next to **Primary Accent** and paste the HEX code in the Hex text box.

    ![Theme Roller dialog open with the Theme and Global Colors sections expanded and the color picker open](images/theme-roller.png " ")

    * Click on the color swatch next to **Body Accent** and paste the HEX code **312D2A** in the Hex text box.

    * The other color swatches automatically updated to variations of the Header Accent color.

    * Click **Save As**.

    * Style Name: **Movies - Dark**

    * Click **Save**.

    * Close the Theme Roller window.

    ![Theme Roller Save As popup](images/save-theme.png " ")

5. You have now updated the color scheme of your app.

## Task 4: Sign up for a TMDB API Key

1. Go to [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup) to sign up for a free account.

2. Once registered, follow the [Getting Started](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) instructions on TMDB Developer site. You will need to enter some of your app and contact information:

    ![The Movie Database API key sign-up page](images/api-key-signup-edit.png " ")

3. After you have received your API Key, copy it and store it somewhere where you will be able to easily access it.

You now know how to create, run, and update the theme of an application. You may now **proceed to the next lab**.
