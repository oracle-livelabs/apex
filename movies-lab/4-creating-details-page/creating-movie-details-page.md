# Create the Movie Details Page

## Introduction

In this lab, you will set up a new page that displays the details of a single movie. When you click on a specific movie from the Movie Search page and, eventually, the My Watchlist page, the details for that movie will be retrieved from the Movie Details TMDB API and shown in the Movie Details page.

Estimated Lab Time: 20 minutes

Watch the video below for a quick walk-through of the lab.

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Create a new page, Movie Details.

- Use the Movie Details REST source to display data on the Movie Details page.

- Connect the Movie Details page to the Movie Search page.

### Prerequisites

- Completion of workshop through Lab 3

## Task 1: Create the Movie Details Page

You will start by creating a new page, Movie Details, which contains a Form. While this form will not display in the final Movie Details page, it will hold the Movie Details data needed to display content in other regions on the page.

1. In the toolbar at the top of the Page Designer, click the **Create** button (3 buttons left of the Save button) and select **Page**.

    ![Create a Page wizard overlaying Page 2 in Page Designer](images/select-page.png " ")

2. Click **Form**.

    ![Create a Page wizard overlaying Page 2 in Page Designer](images/create-page1.png " ")

3. On **Create Form** page, enter/select the following page attributes:

    - Under Page Definition:

        - Page Number: **3**

        - Name: **Movie Details**

        - Mode: **Modal Dialog**

    - Under Data Source:

        - Data Source: **REST Source**

        - REST Data Source: **Movie Details**

    Click **Next**.

    ![Create Page wizard on the Create a Form step to set the page and data source attributes](images/create-form.png " ")

4. Select **ID (Number)** as the Primary Key Column 1 and click **Create Page**.

    ![Create Page wizard on the Create a Form step to set the form primary key](images/create-form-pk.png " ")

    > *Note: You should now be on page 3, the **Movie Details** page.*

5. Make sure **Page 3: Movie Details** root node is selected in the rendering tab on the left.

6. In the Property editor, enter/select the following page attributes:

    - Appearance > Template Options: Click **Use Template Defaults**

        - In the Template Options popup dialog, check the **Stretch to Fit Window** box under Common.

            Click **Ok**.

    - CSS > Inline: Copy and paste the below CSS in the code editor

        ```
        <copy>
        /* Customize Movie Header Card */
        .movie-header-card.a-CardView {
            /* Increase the font sizes for movie name and tag line */
            --a-cv-title-font-size: 24px;
            --a-cv-subtitle-font-size: 16px;

            /* Add additional spacing around the header content */
            --ut-cv-subtitle-margin: 16px 0 0 0;
            display: flex;
            padding: 24px 0;
        }
        .movie-header-card .a-CardView-body {
            /* Remove unnecessary padding */
            padding-top: 0;
        }
        .movie-details {
            /* Center align Card Body text */
            text-align: center;
        }
        ```

    > *Note: The CSS above will style the page header you are going to create. While the original layout and format of the Cards region type can get you pretty far, a little CSS goes a long way in rounding out the entire look of a component or page.*

## Task 2: Create the Header and Overview

You can use the value stored in the P3\_ID page item in the Movie Details form to specify which movie to get the details for. Then you can utilize a few columns from the Movie Details REST source to create a nice header that includes the movie poster, the background image, and the movie title. In addition to the header, you will add a region to display the overview of the movie formatted in a way that is easy to read.

1. You will first need to hide all the Movie page items so that you can still access the values stored in them but create your own content for the page. To do this, you can set the Type of a column to Hidden, which will not display an item on the frontend.

    - To select all items, click on the first item under the Movie region, **P3\_ID**, and then hold shift and click on the last item, **P3\_BELONGS\_TO\_COLLECTION**.

    - In the Page Items editing pane, set Type: **Hidden**

    ![Page 3 open in Page Designer with all Movie Details form items selected and their type set to Hidden in the Property Editor](images/hide-items.png " ")

2. To start creating the header for the Movie Details page, right-click **Content Body** and click **Create Region**.

    ![Page 3 open in Page Designer with all Movie Details form items selected and their type set to Hidden in the Property Editor](images/header-region.png " ")

3. In the Property editor, enter/select the following page attributes:

    - Under Identification:

        - Title: **Header**

        - Type: **Cards**

    - Under Source:

        - Location: **REST Source**

        - REST Source: **Movie Details**

    - Under Local Post Processing:

        - Type: **SQL Query**

        - SQL Query: Replace the existing SQL query with the following:

            ```
            <copy>
            select id,
                   title,
                   'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500'||poster_path as poster_url,
                   'https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500'||backdrop_path as backdrop_url,
                   release_date,
                   runtime,
                   trunc(runtime/60) || 'hr ' ||
                        extract (minute from numtodsinterval((runtime/60), 'HOUR' )) || 'min'
                        as runtime_friendly,
                   vote_average,
                   tagline
              from #APEX$SOURCE_DATA#
            ```

        > *Note: The above query is a simplified version of the original query because you only need a few columns for the header. It also converts RUNTIME into the hours and minutes format and returns it as RUNTIME\_FRIENDLY.*

        ![Page 3 open in Page Designer with Property Editor open on editing the Header region properties](images/header-region-attributes1.png " ")

    - Appearance > Template Options: Click **Use Template Defaults**

        - Style: **Style B**

            Click **Ok**.

        ![Page 3 open in Page Designer with Property Editor open on editing the Header region properties](images/header-region-attributes.png " ")

4. Navigate to **Attributes** tab at the top of the Header region Property Editor. Enter/select the following page attributes:

    - Under Appearance:

        - Layout: **Horizontal (Row)**

        - CSS Classes: **movie-header-card**

    - Card > Primary Key Column 1: **ID**

    - Title > Column: **TITLE**

    - Subtitle > Column: **TAGLINE**

    - Under Body:

        - Advanced Formatting: Toggle **On**

        - HTML Expression: Copy and paste the below HTML expression

            ```
            <copy>
            &lt;div class="movie-details">
                &lt;span title="Release Date">Released &RELEASE_DATE.&lt;/span> &amp;middot;
                &lt;span title="Runtime">&RUNTIME_FRIENDLY.&lt;/span> &amp;middot;
                &lt;span title="&VOTE_AVERAGE. out of 10">&lt;span class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true">&lt;/span> &VOTE_AVERAGE.&lt;/span>
            &lt;/div>
            ```

    - Under Icon and Badge:

        - Icon Source: **Image URL**

        - Image URL: **&POSTER\_URL.**

        - Icon CSS Classes: **w100 h150**

        ![Page 3 open in Page Designer with Property Editor open on editing the Header region attributes](images/header-attributes.png " ")

    - Under Media:

        - Source: **URL Column**

        - URL Column: **BACKDROP\_URL**

        - Position: **As Background Image**

        - Sizing: **Cover**

        ![Page 3 open in Page Designer with Property Editor open on editing the Header region media attributes](images/header-media.png " ")

5. In order to get the details for a specific movie selected from the Search page, you have to update the **movie\_id** parameter that is part of the call to TMDB Movie Details API. When you look at the Details and Header regions in the rendering pane, you can see that under each is a Parameters section, just like there was for Popular and Searched Movies on the Movie Search page.

6. Under the **Movie Details** region, expand the **Parameters** section.

7. Navigate to **movie\_id** parameter.

    - Change the Type from REST Source Default to **Item**.

    - In the Item field, enter **P3\_ID**.

    ![Page 3 open in Page Designer with Property Editor open on editing the movie id parameter](images/movie-id-parameter.png " ")

8. Follow steps 6 and 7 to update the movie_id parameter for the **Header** region.

    ![Page 3 open in Page Designer with Property Editor open on editing the movie id parameter](images/header-movie-id-parameter.png " ")

9. Finally, you will add a region to display the movie Overview to go along with the nice header containing the movie details.

10. In the Rendering tab, right-click **Content Body** and select **Create Region**.

    ![Page 3 open in Page Designer with Property Editor open on editing the movie id parameter](images/overview-region.png " ")

11. In the Property editor, enter/select the following page attributes:

    - Identification > Title: **Overview**

    - Source > HTML Code: **&P3\_OVERVIEW.**

    - Under Appearance:

        - Template: **Content Block**

        - Template Options: Open **Use Template Defaults**

            - Region Title: **Small**

                Click **Ok**.

    ![Page 3 open in Page Designer with Property Editor open on editing the Overview region](images/overview.png " ")

12. Click **Save**.

## Task 3: Connect the Details Page to the Search Page

To be able to view the details of any movie you click on on the Movie Search page, you can link the Details page to the Search page like you did when setting up the Movie Search page and Add Movie button. However, in order to get the details for the specific movie you clicked on, you have to pass some data from the Search page to the Details page.

1. Navigate to page **2: Movie Search** by clicking the down arrow in the page navigation on the Page Designer toolbar.

2. On the Movie Search page, you can see in the rendering pane that both Popular Movies and Searched Movies have an **Actions** section underneath them.

3. Under **Popular Movies** region, right-click **Actions** and select **Create Action**.

    ![Close up of rendering pane with Cards Action context menu open on Page 2 in Page Designer ](images/create-action.png " ")

4. In the Property editor, enter/select the following page attributes:

    - Identification > Type: **Full Card**

        > *Note: The Link section is where you can connect page 3 to page 2 by redirecting the user to a new page, similar to how a user gets to the Movie Search page from the Home page.*

    - Link > Target: Click **No Link Defined** to open the Link Builder dialog.

        - Page: **3**

        > *Note: You also need to set the value of the ID item on page 3 (P3\_ID) so that the Movie Details page has the ID of the movie that was clicked on.*

        - Set Items:

            | Name | Value |
            | ---- | ----- |
            | P3\_ID | &ID.|
            {: title="Set Items"}

        > *Note: You can also use the buttons next to the name and value fields to browse items that you can pass values to. Notice that the options for Name all come from the Movie Details page (P3), because that is the item you want to set. The options for Value are the columns from the Movie Search data source because this is the what you are getting from page 2 and passing to page 3.*

        Click **Ok**.

        ![Link Builder Target dialog for Popular Movies Full Card action open over Page 2 in Page Designer](images/card-action.png " ")

5. Follow step 4 for the **Searched Movies** region to create a Full Card action that redirects to page 3.

6. Click **Save**.

7. Refresh the page where your application is running.

8. Test the Movie Details page by clicking the **Add Movie** button to open the Movie Search page.

9. Click on the movie of choice to see the details.
