# Add Cast List to Movie Details Page (Optional)

## Introduction

This next lab is optional, but it would be fun and informative if a user were able to see not only the basic details of a movie but also the cast list when they open the Movie Details page. The steps are very similar to most of the work you have already done, but this lab will walk you through adding Cast Cards to your Movie Details page.

Estimated Lab Time: 5 minutes
